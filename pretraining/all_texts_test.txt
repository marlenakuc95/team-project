Cathepsin D was purified from porcine spleen to near homogeneity as determined by gel electrophoresis. The isolation scheme involved an acid precipitation of tissue extract, DEAE-cellulose and Sephadex G-200 chromatography, and isoelectric focusing. The end product represented about a 1000-fold purification and about a 10% recovery. The purified enzyme was the major isoenzyme, which represented 60% of cathepsin D present in porcine spleen. Two minor isoenzymes of cathepsin D were present in small amounts. The purified enzyme resembled porcine pepsin in molecular weight (35,000), amino acid composition, and inactivation by specific pepsin inactivators. The pH activity curve of the purified enzyme showed two optima near pH 3 and 4. The relative activities at these optimal pH values were affected by salt concentration. Experimental evidence indicated that the two-optima phenomenon is a property of a single enzyme species.
The hepta-, hexa- and penta-carboxylic porphyrins found in the faeces of rats poisoned with hexachlorobenzene have been separated by high-pressure liquid chromatography and characterized largely by spectroscopie methods. Their structures were confirmed by total synthesis, as part of a programme in which eleven of the fourteen hepta-, hexa- and penta-carboxylic porphyrins derived from uroporphyrin III have now been synthesized as their methyl esters. The four isomeric heptacarboxylic and three of the pentacarboxylic porphyrinogens have been incubated with haemolysates of chicken erythrocytes, and they are all converted into protoporphyrin IX but at different rates. On the basis of this and other evidence we conclude that the decarboxylation of uroporphyrinogen III to coproporphyrinogen III is a stepwise process taking place by a preferred pathway (both in normal and abnormal metabolism); the acetic acid groups are decarboxylated in a sequential clockwise fashion starting with that on the D ring and followed by those on the A, B and C rings. In the poisoned rats the uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase enzyme (or group of enzymes) is probably partially inhibited and the pentacarboxylic porphyrinogen with an acetic acid group on ring C accumulates. The latter is then transformed by a side pathway into dehydroisocoproporphyrinogen and thence into dehydroisocoproporphyrin and its congeners.
This study shows that the staff working in an operating room is repeatedly being exposed to appreciable doses of halothane vapours. A continuous measurement of the concentrations in the ambient air gave results ranging from 5 to 30 ppm. Summits from 50 to 70 ppm were noted. The inhaling of halothane was evidenced by the presence of brominated metabolites in the urine of the staff. A mean 14,59 mg/l was found with women anaesthesists. Therefore it is quite possible that the halothane spread in the air should be held responsible for the discomfort felt in particular by anaesthesists. To prevent this risk of chronic intoxication by those vapours, there ought to be a device permitting either to evacuate them outside or to collect them while regenerating the polluted air through an active carbon filter if one has not got at one's disposal an airing system offering over 20 renewals of fresh air per hour. The fitting up of a permanent control device equipped with warning light and bell is also justified.
Secondary and tertiary amino homologs of the title compounds have been prepared, bearing an N-isopropyl group. In peripheral evaluation, certain members of the series exhibited beta-adrenergic agonist effects of lower activity than isoproterenol. N-Methyl-N-isopropyl-5,6-dihydroxytetralin exhibited marked properties consistent with its being an alpha agonist, and it is concluded that introduction of considerable bulk about the nitrogen of a catecholamine does not a priori destroy alpha-agonist effects. The compounds qualitatively paralleled the effects of dopamine in assays based upon direct intrastriatal administration in rats, although they were less potent than dopamine.
Delta5-3beta-hydroxysteroid oxidoreductase was extracted in magnesium-containing Tris buffer from sonicated Streptomyces griseocarneus cells. The enzyme was partially purified (150 X) by ion exchange chromatography and gel filtration following (NH4)2SO4 fractionation. Upon gel filtration on Sephadex G-75 to G-200, the greatest part of the activity gave a peak in the fractionation range. The enzyme obtained from the gel yielded small enzyme molecules on repeated chromatography. A molecular weight of 32 to 36 000 was calculated for the activity appearing in the fractionation range of Sephadex G-75 to G-200. The enzyme is highly specific for the irreversible oxidation of the 3beta-hydroxyl group in steroids with a trans-anellated A : B ring system with either C5 or C6 double bond. Delta5-3-ketosteroids are converted into delta5-3-ketosteroids at a high rate, but the isomerase activity cannot be separated from the oxidoreductase activity either by chromatography or by selective heat inactivation. NAD, NADP, FMN or FAD did not influence the activity, but the enzyme is inactive in the absence of molecular oxygen.
I have measured the proportion of host cells in a popliteal lymph node undergoing a graft-versus-host (GVH) reaction. By using cytotoxic alloantisera with specificity for donor and host Ag-B determined antigens, it was found that about 90% of live cells suspended from the node were of host origin. The role of host T lymphocytes in this reaction was evaluated by investigating GVH-reactivity in hosts depleted of T cells (B rats). These rats differed very little from normal hosts with regard to lymph node weight increase (which was, in fact, slightly enhanced), increase in node cellularity, and donor/host contribution. The number of i.v. infused 51Cr-labelled thoracic duct lymphocytes localizing in popliteal lymph nodes undergoing a GVH-reaction was increased, but the significance of this phenomenon for the lymph node enlargement is questionable.
A simple radioactive-substrate assay for prostaglandin synthase (EC 1.14.99.1), which uses t.l.c. to measure simultaneously different prostaglandins synthesized from one precursor substrate, was developed. Rabbit kidney-medulla prostaglandin synthase catalyses the formation of prostaglandin E2, prostaglandin F2alpha and prostaglandin D2 from arachidonic acid. Fractionation of crude homogenates indicated that the microsomal fraction possessed the highest specific activity of prostaglandin synthase, whereas the soluble fraction exhibited little enzyme activity but rather contained a heat-labile inhibitory macromolecular factor(s), which might be attributed to the serum albumin present in this fraction. The microsomal fraction possessed low intrinsic enzyme activity, but the actvity could be fully stimulated by the presence of both GSH (reduced glutathione) and a phenolic cofactor. Only cysteine could partially replace GSH, whereas other thiols were inactive and some were even inhibitory. A variety of phenolic compounds, including catecholamines, dopamine (3,4-dihydroxyphenethylamine), 5-hydroxytryptamine and quinol, were active in stimulating prostaglandin synthase. In all cases, the stimulation was reflected in the synthesis of all three prostaglandins with ratios not significantly altered by different phenolic cofactors. The synthesis of each of the different prostaglandins appeared to have similar pH optima. The enzyme system was not inhibited by thiol-group inhibitors or a variety of metal chelators except for cyanide and 8-hydroxyquinoline. Characterization of the kidney-medulla prostaglandin synthase system indicated that it exhibited properties similar to those of the enzyme system present in seminal vesicles.
Human hemoglobin was spin labeled with 4-isothiocanato-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperdinooxyl, which is known to bind specifically to the N-terminal alpha-amino groups of proteins and slightly to the reactive sulfhydryl groups. Electron spin resonance (ESR) analysis indicated a partially resolved five-line spectrum, suggesting that the label was attached to at least two different binding sites. Using specific blocking reagents prior to spin labeling, the two binding sites were attributed to the sulfhydryl group of beta-93 (immobile) and the alpha-amino group of the N-terminal valines (mobile). The relative motion of the spin at one set of binding sites was restricted regardless of the state of ligation and pH, while the motion at the other site showed dependence on those parameters, e.g. the spin-labeled N-terminal ends of deoxyhemoglobin have restricted motion at all pH ranges studied, while those of oxyhemoglobin are relatively free to move at the basic pH range, but become more restricted in the acidic pH range.
The administration of phenylbutazone together with warfarin to dogs resulted in an elevation of the free fraction of warfarin in the plasma from 2-6 to 8-0% thus providing direct support for the notion that phenylbutazone induced inhibition of warfarin binding to plasma proteins. This inhibition as evaluated by a kinetic method was accompanied by a two-fold decrease in the plasma half-life of warfarin from 18-4 h in control animals to 9-6 h in phenylbutazone-treated animals. Marked increases in warfarin-induced hypoprothrombinaemia were observed when at doses up to 8 mg kg-1 (orally) it was given with phenylbutazone (50 mg kg-1, orally). The unbound fraction of warfarin in canine plasma ranged from 1-7 to 4-3% indicating individual differences in the extent of the plasma binding of warfarin in the dog.
Resistant hypertension can be defined in terms of lack of blood pressure response to hypotensive agents, but there may be a big difference between standing and lying blood pressure levels. In general target organ damage and papilloedema improve if the standing blood pressure is controlled; however, progression can occasionally be documented when only the supine blood pressure remains uncontrolled. Resistant hypertension was a frequent phenomenon when ganglion blocking agents and hydrallazine were the only effective hypotensive agents. With the advent of the thiazides, effective control of the blood pressure became the exception rather than the rule; however, it was not until the advent of adrenergic blocking agents that reduction of supine blood pressures was regularly achieved. The addition of hydrallazine or prazosin to a combination of a thiazide and beta-adrenoreceptor blocking agent produces a further significant fall in the blood pressure lying and standing. This combination will control the blood pressure in most patients, but a few remain refractory to maximum doses and will require treatment with oral diazoxide or minoxidil. Both these powerful vasodilators are very effective in resistant hypertension. Oral diazoxide permits excellent control and allows a 10-fold reduction in the doses of other agents. Minoxidil usually needs to be combined with moderate doses of beta-blocking agents to reduce the marked reflex tachycardia. Only a 50% reduction in other hypotensive agents was achieved in patients treated with minoxidil and two patients proved resistant to minoxidil, but subsequently responded to oral diazoxide.
Sodium butyrate produces reversible changes in morphology, growth rate, and enzyme activities of several mammalian cell types in culture. Some of these changes are similar to those produced by agents which increase the intracellular level of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) or by analogs of cAMP. Sodium butyrate increases the intracellular level of cAMP by about two fold in neuroblastoma cells; therefore, some of the effects of sodium butyrate on these cells may in part be mediated by cAMP. Sodium butyrate appears to have properties of a good chemotherapeutic agent for neuroblastoma tumors because the treatment of neuroblastoma cells in culture causes cell death and "differentiation"; however, it is either innocuous or produces reversible morphological and biochemical alterations in other cell types.
The effect of pH, mental ions, and denaturing reagents on the thermal stability of thermophilic alpha-amylase [EC 3.2.1.1] were examined. The enzyme was most stable at around pH 9.2, which is coincident with the isoelectric point of the enzyme. The stability of the enzyme was increased by the addition of calcium, strontium, and sodium ions. The addition of calcium ions markedly stabilized the enzyme. The protective effects of calcium and sodium ions were additive. At room temperature, no detectable destruction of the helical structure of the enzyme was observed after incubation for 1 hr in the presence of 1% sodium dodecylsulfate, 8 M urea or 6 M guanidine-HC1. The addition of 8 M urea or 6 M guanidine-HC1 lowered the thermal denaturation temperature of the enzyme. The enzyme contained one atom of tightly bound intrinsic calcium per molecule which could not be removed by electrodialysis unless the enzyme was denatured. The rate constants of inactivation and denaturation reactions in the absence and presence of calcium ions were measured and thermodynamic parameters were determined. The presence of calcium ions caused a remarkable decrease in the activation entropy.
3-week-old male rats were fed on a casein diet containing 1% (w/w) of chlorogenic acid in order to find out if the ingestion of chlorogenic acid may be associated with a reduced utilization of dietary proteins or with causing other adverse effects. The protein efficiency ratio, biological value and digestibility of this diet did not differ from a corresponding casein diet free from chlorogenic acid. No change was observed in the nitrogen balance of the experimental rats. Neither did the rats show any change in hematological values or volumes and pH of the urine. Some deviation was noticed in the weights of kidneys and adrenals of the chlorogec acid-free casein diet. The findings that were made were normal in the microscopic examinations of various organs. Chlorogenic acid did not seem to influence the ultrastructure of the liver as revealed by electron microscopy.
The cerebral haemodynamic effects of CT 1341 also called Alfatesin, an anaesthetic steroid, were studied in the cat by means of the Xenon 133 isotopic clearance method to measure the cerebral blood flow. The injection or intravenous drip of Alfatesin in animals whose arterio PCO2 was kept unchanged induced a cerebral blood flow diminution, the importance of which was proportional to the injected dose. The cerebral blood flow fall was partly due to a cerebral arterio vasoconstriction evidenced by direct observation of the cortex vessels and by a diminution of the intracranial presure. During a deep anaesthesia induced by Alfatesin with recurrent burst suppression, there was a loss of cerebral blood flow autoregulation while the CO2 cerebral vascular reactivity was maintained. This last result accounts for the increase in cerebral blood flow parallel to the hypercapnia that could be observed among animals breathing freely.
Calcium carbonate is added to fermentation media in biosynthesis of tetracyclines for providing definite pH values and binding tetracycline into insoluble complexes. Seven different samples were studied with respect to their physical properties, such as the microscopic size of the particles, their form, capacity for agglomeration, specific volume, rate of the particle precipitation and chemical properties, such as purity, buffer capacity, effect on the medium pH before and after sterilization. The above properties were studied in comparison with activity chlortetracycline biosynthesis. Microfine calcium carbonate proved to be the best from the point of view of productivity of Str. aureofaciens. With its use the activity of the culture fluid increased by 20 per cent as compared to the other samples. The titration curve of the sample had the lowest bend.
The reflex tachycardia elicited by rapid intravenous infusions of a blood substitute was studied in 21 chronic cats with spinal sections at C8. All animals could breath spontaneously. The day after section the average resting heart rate (HR) and arterial pressure (AP) were 109 beats/min and 98/67 mmHg, respectively. Vagal blockade with atropine (0.5-0.7 mg/kg iv) was performed prior to each infusion, increasing the average HR To 127 beats/min. In 39 infusions in 21 cats the average increase in HR was 10 beats/min (range from -6 to +22 beats/min). A tachycardia was observed in all but five trials, four of which were obtained in two cats that subsequently responded with a tachycardia. In seven animals the neural circuit mediating the response was partially or totally interrupted by section of several thoracic dorsal roots (T1-T4 or T1-T6) and of the spinal cord at the inferior level of these sections (between T6 and T7). The tachycardia response was progressively reduced and finally abolished by these procedures. These experiments indicate that spinal neural mechanisms are likely to contribute to the phenomenon first described by Bainbridge.
The kinetics of the hydrogen-deuterium exchange reaction in a subtilisin inhibitor from Streptomyces albogriseolus has been examined by infrared absorption measurement in aqueous solutions at various pH values and temperatures. In the analysis of each piece of kinetic data, it was assumed that the total 104 peptide hydrogen atoms are classified into three kinetic classes A, B1, and B2, and that the sizes of these classes are 72, 15, and 17, respectively at every pH and at every temperature examined. On the basis of the peak position determined for the amide II band in each stage of the exchange reaction, an approximate assignment was suggested of the A, B1 and B2 respectively to an unordered structure, a beta-structure,and an alpha-helical structure in the molecule. This assignment was supported by infrared absorption measurement of a film of this protein and by circular dichroic study of the solutions. On the basis of the temperature effect on the hydrogen-exchange rate constants and on the basis of ultraviolet absorption study in the higher temperature region (40 to 90 degrees C), a discussion has been made on the nature of the fluctuation of the molecular structure of this protein.
Weight-average elution volumes of sulphatase A (an arylsulphate sulphohydrolase, EC 3.1.6.1) from Sephadex G-200 have been determined as functions of protein concentration, pH, ionic strength and temperature. The results are used to calculate the apparent association equilibrium constants for tetramer formation and the associated standard-state thermodynamic parameters. While the apparent association constant decreased from 10(28) to 10(21) M-3 on increasing the pH from 4.5 to 5.6 at ionic strength 0.1, at any particular pH value studied it was relatively insensitive to temperature variation so that deltaH is close to zero and tetramer formation in solution is associated with a positive entropy change. At pH 5.0, increasing the ionic strength from 0.1 to 2 decreased the association constant by a factor of 100. Methylumbelliferone sulphate has no effect on the association of sulphatase A. The equilibrium results are used to define the degree of association of sulphatase A likely to encountered in experiments designed to elucidate its kinetic properties. In the liver lysosome, the tetramer is probably the dominant species. The monomer and tetramer of sulphatase A have similar, or identical, specific activities with nitrocatechol sulphate and 4-methylumbelliferone sulphate as substrates. With nitrocatechol sulphate, sulphatase A shows Michaelis kinetics under conditions where the monomer is the dominant species and non-Michaelis kinetics where the tetramer is dominant. There is apparently a negative cooperativity between the monomer units in the tetramer. In 2 mM sodium taurodeoxycholate and 0.035 M MnCl2, but not in 0.1 M NaCl, the tetramer shows Michaelis kinetics. This is not due to dissociation of the tetramer. The critical micellar concentration of sodium taurodeoxycholate is about 0.8 mM in both 0.1 M NaCl and 0.035 M McCl2 but the aggregation number is greater in the latter.
Interferon-like virus inhibitors appeared in the blood serum of animals and in the culture fluid 15 min.--1 hour and 4-6 hours after administration of AET (S, beta-amino-ethylisotiuronium) and cystaphos (monosodium salt of beta-aminoethylthiophosphorus acid). These inhibitors showed species-specificity, were inactivated by trypsin and by heating at 37 degrees C for 2 hours and at 56 degrees C for 1 hour, did not sediment at 100,000 g. It is assumed that these are two different inhibitors of which the one forming the early peak pre-exists in the cell. It is probably associated with cell membranes and is released as a result of chemical effect of aminothyols. The late peak of inhibitor is synthesized de novo as inducated by its sensitivity to the effect of puromycin and cycloheximide.
Serum levels of testosterone, androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone were measured before and after 5 days of treatment with hCG (2000 IU/d) in 36 prepubertal boys with cryptorchidism and 11 with hypospadias in order to determine whether a defect in androgen synthesis could be a common cause for these disorders. Baseline and stimulated levels of testosterone, androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone were similar in patients with unilateral cryptorchidism, monorchism and hypospadias; baseline and stimulated levels of testosterone were lower in boys with bilateral cryptorchidism. Testosterone levels did not correlate with either the anatomical location of the testis in patients with unilateral cryptorchidism or with the site of the urethra in boys with hypospadias. Seven of 36 patients with cryptorchidism had a positive family history of a similar disorder; testosterone levels were similar in patients with and without a family history. It is concluded: 1) in all patients studied, the gonadotropin dependent phase of testosterone production is present; 2) hCG stimulation cannot detect unilateral Leydig cell dysfunction; and 3) in familial cases of cryptorchidism, some factor other than an abnormality in androgen synthesis may be responsible for the hereditary tendency.
The rate of inactivation of acid phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.2) from bovine brain by dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (Nbs2) is identical to the rate of titration of one of the two SH groups of this enzyme. The rate of inactivation of the enzyme by Nbs2 is pH dependent and, at 300 mM NaCl, can be described by the reaction of a single SH group of pK 8.4. At low ionic strength the pK determined from the k inactivation vs. pH profile is 7.7 and the results deviate markedly from the predicted values at pH values less than or equal to 6. The decrease of V upon addition of salts is paralleled by the decrease of inactivation rate by Nbs2. The relevance of SH groups in catalysis by bovine brain acid phosphatase is discussed in terms of these data.
The preparation and stereochemical characterization of all three isomeric forms of 4-acetoxy-1, 2, 6-trimethyl-4-phenylpiperidine is described. Of these, only the t-2-Me, c-6-Me, r-4-OCOMe isomer was an effective analgesic in mice (2.3 X pethidine) as judged by the hot-plate test. The results, together with reported data, demonstrate the potency raising effects of axial methyl alpha- to nitrogen and the lowering action of equatorial alpha-methyl substituents in reversed esters of pethidine.
Distal urethral stenosis in girls as well as meatal and bulbar narrowed urethral segments in boys are still subjects of discussion about their pathologic value in the literature. The urodynamic findings in enuretic children by urethral pressure profile and cystometry frequently point to a outflow resistance. Calibration with bougies  boule, urethroscopy and permictional cysturethrography disclose such urethral narrowing. The survey of our own 107 enuritic children shows that urethrotomy has given good results relative to urodynamic data. The effect of methantheline medications consists in suppressing the hyperactivity of the detrusor.
The management of hernias, hydroceles and undescended testicles is reviewed on the basis of current practice as reported in recent literature and of the author's experience at Addington Hospital, Durban.
The degradation of biological activity of virus-induced murine interferon was determined in linear nonisothermal and multiple isothermal tests. The stabilizing effect of pH during heating on interferon in solution was greatest at low pH, such that pH 2 greater than pH 5 greater than pH 7 greater than or equal to pH 9; freeze-dried preparations of interferon were also more heat-stable at acid pH than at neutral pH. Heat stability was a function of the H+-ion concentration rather than the ionic composition of the buffer; interferon solutions containing monovalent cations with different ionic radii had similar heat stability. A change in the H+ ion concentration was a critical event during the cooling of heated interferon: a shift in the direction of acidity contributed to stability whereas a shift towards alkalinity led to inactivation. The rate of cooling of heated interferon significantly influenced its residual activity. Rapid cooling and sudden freezing decreased the residual activities of interferons at pH 2 and 9 more than "normal" cooling, an effect not observed at pH 7. Interferon heated to 80degree C could not be reactivated at 40degree C or 55degree C. Interferon of higher apparent molecular weight was more heat-stable than that with lower apparent molecular weight. It is postulated that the physicochemical alterations in the aqueous environment significantly affecting the stability of interferon operate by producing changes in the size and/or conformation of interferon molecules. A model is proposed that relates thermal inactivation to different possible molecular states of interferon.
The bacterial protein colicin K, when added to sensitive Escherichia coli in the presence of 3,3'-dihexyloxacarbocyanine, cuases a doubling in fluorescence of the probe. Glucose and oxygen cause a decreased fluorescence while anoxia and cyanide cause a rise in fluorescence. These results in conjunction with the work of other laboratories suggest that colicin K causes a depolarization of the transmembrane electrical potential. Fluorescence in the absence of colicin K was relatively independent of KCl, NaCl, and MgCl2 concentrations below 0.1 M. Although colicin K caused rapid efflux of the K+ analogue 86Rb+, the fluorescence rise was only partially blocked by 0.13 M KCl. The level of fluorescence caused by the action of colcin K was inversely proportional to the logarithm of the concentration of MgCl2 over the range of 2 muM to 4 mM. This suggests that a Nernst electrochemical potential for an anion can counteract a membrane depolarization caused by colcin. After colcin K action, the fluorescence of the carbocyanine could be further increased by anoxia or cyanide. The distribution of the weak base dimethyloxazolidinedione indicated that the pH in the interior of aerobic E. coli supplied with lactate was alkaline by 0.1 unit and unaffected by colicin. These results suggest that colicin K does not completely depolarize the membrane potential and does not interfere with the component of membrane energization generated by electron transport. Colicin K does not act as a cationophore. The partial depolarization of the membrane may account for the inhibition of active solute transport caused by colicin K.
Bilateral adrenalectomy (10 days) increased the monoamine oxidase activity of the rat heart, vas deferens, spleen, superior cervical ganglion, and hypothalamus but not that of the rest of the brain, kidney, and liver. Experiments were made to determine whether the increased activity was due to neurogenic influences and whether the enhanced activity of monoamine oxidase was intra- or extraneuronally located. Ganglionic blockade with chlorisondamine failed to alter the rise in cardiac monoamine oxidase. Likewise, superior cervical ganglion monoamine oxidase was unaffected by surgical denervation. 6-Hydroxydopamine abolished the increase in monoamine oxidase activity of the vas deferens, spleen, and superior cervical ganglion but failed to alter that of the kidney, hypothalamus, and the rest of the brain. Cardiac monoamine oxidase was reduced markedly by 6-hydroxydopamine, but the remaining activity was still significantly elevated over the respective control values. The data suggest that the increase in organ monoamine oxidase is predominantly of neuronal origin and that this increase is not due to transsynaptic induction.
Certain conclusions may be drawn from the present review and presentation of new data concerning the unilaterally cryptorchid patient and possible subfertility: 1. The truly undescended testis--not the retractile testis of infancy--will not descend spontaneously after 1 year of age. 2. The seminal quality of the unilaterally cryptorchid patient is definitely impaired, although not rendered infertile, in a great majority of patients irrespective of the time of surgery. 3. The dystopic position of the maldescended testis appears to superimpose a second insult on what very likely may be an inherent abnormality in the cryptorchid testis, the latter accounting, perhaps, for its abnormal extrascrotal position. 4. Orchiopexy before the age of 5 seems advisable to ensure minimal histologic changes that may be secondary to the testis' increased exposure to elevated extrascrotal temperature. 5. The cryptorchid testis will be smaller in size irrespective of surgery, and usually correlates with significant testicular pathology. 6. Basal levels of gonadotropins, especially follicle-stimulating hormone, are likely to be elevated, but this does not necessarily imply overwhelming testicular damage. Androgen production should not be affected. 7. Surgical correction is advised when human chorionic gonadotropin stimulation fails to produce teticular descent, thereby defining the maldescended testis as not merely retractile but truly "crytorchid."
Counter-current immunoelectrohporesis is a rapid sensitive method for detecting pneumococcal capsular antigens in sputum. A result can be obtained within 45 minutes. The optimum conditions for performing the test are given. Counter-current immunoelectrophoresis works with all the 33 pneumococcal antigens tested except type 14. Better precipitin lines are obtained when the gel-support is acid (pH 6-6) than when it is alkaline (pH 8-6). Omniserum is as effective as group-specific sera for the identification of pneumococcal capsular antigens. The findings suggest that pneumococcal infection was present in 44% of 300 unselected suspected chest infections. Culture for pneumococci was positive in only 15% of these cases. The clinical importance of these findings is still being studied but our experience has shown that patients with chest infections should have effective antipneumococcal antibiotics as part of their regimen and that the laboratory diagnosis may be made quickly and accurately by counter-current immunoelectrophoresis.
When envelope-free spinach chloroplasts are incubated with stromal protein, catalytic NADP, catalytic ADP, radioactive bicarbonate and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, 14CO2 fixation starts immediately upon illumination but oxygen evolution is delayed. The delay is increased by the addition of fructose 6-phosphate and by a variety of factors known (or believed) to increase fructose bisphosphatase activity (such as dithiothreitol, more alkaline pH, higher [Mg] and antimycin A). Conversely, the lag can be decreased or eliminated by the addition of an ATP-generating system. Bearing in mind the known inhibition, by ADP, of sn-phospho-3-glycerate (3-phosphoglycerate) reduction it is concluded that the lag in O2 evolution results from the production of ribulose 5-phosphate from fructose bisphosphate and that this in turn inhibits the reoxidation of NADPH by adversely affecting the ADP/ATP ratio. The results are discussed in their relation to the mode of action of antimycin A and to regulation of the reductive pentose phosphate pathway.
Sodium acetate (AC) is routinely used in dialysis solutions in hemodialysis units as it provides a ready source of fixed base. The renal dynamics of the buffer salt are not well known. Anesthetized dogs received i.v. infusions of AC at a rate of 40 to 600 muEq/kg/min. Urinary AC and bicarbonate excretion was measured and correlated with PAH and creatinine clearance and urinary electrolyte excretion. AC appeared in the urine as quickly as it was detected in the plasma. Its excretion gradually increased and tended to parallel bicarbonate excretion. PAH clearance increased with the advent of AC infusion, plasma pH and bicarbonate increase as AC is introduced. AC infusion caused an immediate drop in blood pressure. The systolic blood pressure returned to control in 3-5 min; there was a more gradual return in diastolic pressure. We conclude that AC is filtered and excreted into the urine at low plasma levels and has a low renal threshold.
A newly developed, dual-function pH and PCO2 sensor was evaluated in this study. The sensors were placed in the femoral arteries of dogs anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital. Comparisons were made between systemic arterial pH and PCO2 measured using the sensor and those measured from blood samples drawn at 15-min intervals over a 7-h period using a bench instrument. The mean pH of the bench instrument measurements was 7.43. The mean difference of the sensor measurements from the bench instrument measurements for 207 comparisons was 0.0003 pH +/- 0.061 SD. The mean PCO2 of the bench instrument measurements was 40 mmHg. The mean difference of the sensor measurements from those of the bench instrument for 212 comparisons was -1.43 mmHg +/- 5.17 SD. The sensors performed equally well in the presence of metabolic or respiratory acidosis and alkalosis. The dual-function sensors evaluated in this study are useful for trend monitoring of pH and PCO2 over at least a 7-h period without recalibration. With improvement in the consistency of sensor construction, these sensors will be reliable in vivo sensing devices for blood pH and PCO2 and thus valuable research and clinical instruments.
In approximately 10,000 admissions in a 12 months period, at University Teaching Hospital, Lusaka 85 cases of meningitis were recorded. The signs and symptoms in these patients do not greatly differ from other similar studies in Africa. The commonest organism isolated was pneumococcus. There was high mortality rate which was to a large extent due to parents not bringing their children to hospital early enough for medical treatment to be instituted. This is borne out by the fact that 50% of the children with meningitis died within the first 24 hours. The C.S.F. protein and peripheral white blood count may be of prognostic value. Spasticity, cranial nerve palsises hydrocephalus and subdural effusion were the commonest complications.
Nucleotides have at least two functions in eukaryotic cilia and flagella. ATP, originating in the cells, is utilized for motility by energy-transducing protein(s) called dynein, and the binding of guanine nucleotides to tubulin, and probably certain transformations of the bound nucleotides, are prerequisites for the assembly of microtubules. Besides dynein, which can be solubulized from Chlamydomonas flagella as a heterogeneous, Mg2+ or Ca2+-activated ATPase, we have purified and characterized five other flagellar enzymes involved in nucleotide transformations. A homogeneous, low molecular weight, Ca2+-specific adenosine triphosphatase was isolated, which was inhibited by Mg2+ and was not specific for ATP. This enzyme was not formed by treating purified dynein with proteases. It was absent from extracts of Tetrahymena cilia. Its function might be an auxiliary energy transducer, or in steering or tactic responses. Two species of adenylate kinase were isolated, one of which was much elevated in regenerating flagella; the latter was also present in cell bodies. A large part of flagellar nucleoside diphosphokinase activity could not be solubilized. Two soluble enzyme species were identified, one of which was also present in cell bodies. Since these enzymes are of interest because they might function in microtubule assembly, we studied the extent to which brain nucleoside diphosphokinase co-polymerizes with tubulin purified by repeated cycles of polymerization. Arginine kinase was not detected in Chlamydomonas flagellar extracts.
An active prostaglandin (PG) synthetase was found in the 12100 g pellet of reproductive tract homogenates of the male house cricket, Acheta domesticus. Comparatively, the 12100 g supernatant and the microsomal fractions were inactive. The PG synthetase in the pellet fraction was characterized in terms of cofactor, temperature, pH, and incubation time requirements. Indomethacin, a known inhibitor of mammalian PG synthetase, was not inhibitory to the cricket synthetase. The procedure and findings are relevant to PG synthetase studies of any organism or tissue.
The effect of isoproterenol (IPR) on bone-marrow cAMP content was investigated in vivo and in vitro. In unirradiated CFW mice, the bone-marrow cAMP content was found to be elevated by the administration of noradrenaline, adrenaline and isoproterenol. After IPR administration, the increase in cAMP was biphasic with maxima at 1 and 15 min. An increase in cAMP content was also noted in bone-marrow of sublethally-irradiated mice, but no further increase was observed 15 min after the administration of IPR. Elevation of cAMP by either IPR or radiation was prevented by pretreatment with the beta-adrenergic blocking agent--propranolol. IPR was also effective in increasing the cAMP content when added to suspension of bone-marrow cells. This effect was abolished by propranolol. IPR did not increase cAMP levels in bone-marrow cells isolated from irradiated animals. The results suggest that the differentiated bone-marrow cells have beta-adrenergic receptors.
This paper reviews experiments that have revealed distinct differences between the dorsal and median raphe nuclei in the rat midbrain. The raphe nuclei appear to be hetrogeneous with respect to their anatomical projections to the forebrain, their relevance to specific behaviors, and their pharmacological responses. Startle response measures are useful indicators of the functional state of serotonergic system originating in the median raphe. As a way to study individual cells within the various raphe nuclei, microspectroflurimetric techniques are promising.
The distribution of arabinosylcytosine (ara-C) and its metabolites has been measured in the liver, small intestine, spleen, and kidney of mice inoculated ip 5-6 days earlier with L1210 leukemia cells. Two major metabolites were found in the tissues--the nucleotides and the deaminated inactive product, arabinosyluracil (ara-U). The decay curve of ara-C in most of these tissues was curvilinear; the ara-C half-lives estimated from the terminal phases were 8. 11, 12, and 12 hr for spleen, kidney, intestine, and liver tissues, respectively. The ara-C half-life was not correlated with the deoxycytidine deaminase activity in the tissues. However, the deaminase activity in vitro correlated well with the amount of ara-U present in vivo. Similar analyses were made for L1210 leukemic cells and ascites fluid. A high nucleotide level was found in the cells and a significant amount of nucleotides was also identifiable in the ascites fluid. The activities of deoxycytidine kinase, but not of deoxycytidine deaminase, in host tissues of mice inoculated with L1210 leukemic cells sensitive to ara-C were greater than in those of normal mice. The phosphorylating activities in vitro correlated with the amount of nucleotide present in vivo in mice bearing  L1210 leukemic cells. However, the infiltration of leukemic cells containing high kinase activities into the host tissues accounted for most, if not all, of the nucleotide level in these tissues. This is further evidenced by the fact that inoculating mice with L1210 leukemic cells resistant to ara-C did not alter the kinase activity or nucleotide levels of the host tissues; these resistant cells contain negligible amounts of ara-C phosphorylating activities.
Kinetics of inactivation of hydrogenases is exemplified with the enzyme from Chloropseudomonas ethylica. The effect of gaseous phase, temperature, pH on the inactivation kinetics has been studied. Inactivation of the hydrogenase during incubation of an enzyme solution in air has been studied. Analysis of the kinetic data allowed the conclusion to be made that inactivation involves two forms of the enzyme which differ in their activity and resistance to inactivating actions. Stabilities of the mean time of operation of hydrogenases from Chloropseudomonas ethylica and Thiocapsa roseopersicina are compared. The mechanism of inactivation of hydrogenases from the two sources were found to be similar in many ways.
Three homogeneous preparations of D-alanine carboxypeptidases I have been obtained from Escherichia coli strain H2143, termed enzymes IA, IB, and IC. Enzyme IA purified from the membrane after extraction with Triton X-100 appeared on sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis to be a polypeptide doublet whose monomer molecular weights were about 32,000 and 34,000. In addition to D-alanine carboxypeptidase activity, it catalyzed a transpeptidase reaction with several substrates, bound [14C]penicillin G, had a weak penicillinase activity, but was devoid of endopeptidase activity. Enzyme IB obtained from the membrane after LiCl extraction and enzyme IC obtained from the supernatant solution were either identical or extremely similar. They were composed of a single polypeptide whose monomer molecular weight was about 41,000. In addition to carboxypeptidase activity, they catalyzed an endopeptidase reaction, had weak penicillinase activity, and had very poor transpeptidase activity, but did not bind [14C]penicillin G. Some data relating to the mechanism of catalysis by these enzymes are described. Their possible physiological role is discussed.
A dog liver preparation in situ was used. Intravenous infusion of isoprenaline caused a decrease of plasma potassium levels, which was preceded, in some of the animals infused with higher doses, by a rise in plasma potassium. Propranolol abolished both these effects of isoprenaline, whereas phentolamine was devoided of effects. Liver potassium was not affected by isoprenaline infusions. Phenylephrine caused release of potassium from the liver; this effect was blocked by phentolamine, but not by propranolol. Combination of phenylephrine and isoprenaline induced a super-additive hyperkalemia. Analysis of these results led to the conclusion that the rise in plasma potassium due to phenylephrine might reflect a direct kalemotropic effect and an indirect hypoxemic effect. Isoprenaline seems to increase the hypoxemia caused by phenylephrine by opening the intrahepatic vascular shunts.
The effect of laser beam on the survival of skin allotransplants has been studied. Irradiation of the donor skin and of the recipient graft bed improved the survival of the graft. The graft protecting effect of anti-thymocyte serum was considerably enhanced by laser irradiation.
The effects of unilateral and bilateral cryptorchidism and castration on serum concentrations of testosterone, FSH and LH in adult male rats were examined. The results provide no evidence for compensatory growth or development of the remaining scrotal testes up to 32 days after unilateral castration, although the scrotal testis of unilaterally cryptorchid rats showed enlargement when compared with those of control rats (P less than 0 - 05) at 32 days. Unilateral treatments had few significant effects on serum hormones, but testosterone was increased on day 4 (P less than 0 - 05) in unilaterally cryptorchid rats and on day 32 (P less than 0 - 05) in unilaterally castrated rats, compared with controls, and FSH levels were higher in unilaterally castrated rats on day 16 (P less than 0 - 05). Bilateral cryptorchidism caused an increase in serum FSH within 4 days (P less than 0 - 05) and in serum LH by 8 days (P less than 0-05) after surgery, with both hormones reaching levels double those found in control rats (P less than 0 - 01) by day 16, while testosterone levels were maintained at or above control values. Bilateral castration resulted in a marked decrease in testosterone levels (P less than 0 - 01) and a sharp increase in serum gonadotrophins. FSH had nearly doubled (P less than 0 - 01) and LH had increased fourfold (P less than 0 - 01) 4 days after castration, their levels reaching 773% (LH) and 287% (FSH) of control values by 32 days (P less than 0 - 01). The observations support the hypothesis of a separate, testosterone-independent feedback system of the testis on the hypophysis.
FDP aldolase was found to be present in the cell-free extracts of Rhizobium leguminosarum, Rhizobium phaseoli, Rhizobium trifolii, Rhizobium meliloti, Rhizobium lupini, Rhizobium japonicum and Rhizobium species from Arachis hypogaea and Sesbania cannabina. The enzyme in 3 representative species has optimal activity at pH 8.4 in 0.2M veronal buffer. The enzyme activity was completely lost by treatment at 60 degrees C for 15 min. The Km values were in the range from 2.38 to 4.55 X 10(-6)M FDP. Metal chelating agents inhibited enzyme activity, but monovalent or bivalent metal ions failed to stimulate the activity. Bivalent metal ions in general were rather inhibitory.
A double-blind placebo crossover trail (2 periods, each of 6 wk) was carried out in 12 patients. In the first period the patients were randomly allocated to either their individual established dose of prazosin or to the same number of placebo tablets; treatment was reversed after 6 wk. Blood pressure was higher by 17/8 mm Hgin the lying posture and by 24/14 mm Hg in the standing posture during placebo than during prazosin treatment. Standing pulse rate and body weight were higher and plasma renin activity lower during prazosin treatment. Postural hypotension occurring 1 to 2 hr after the first few doses was noted in one third of the patients when they resumed prazosin treatment after the placebo course.
Ketamine given IV in a dose of 2 mg/kg caused a significant reduction in Pao2 in 7 patients spontaneously breathing with an unassisted airway. Under the same conditions, in 7 patients, ketamine (2 mg/kg IV) preceded by diazepam (0.2 mg/kg IV) also caused a reduction in Pao2 not significantly different from that caused by ketamine. In some patients, alarmingly low levels of Pao2 ( less than or equal to 40 torr) were seen following ketamine administration. Based on these findings, the authors recommend that O2 and ventilatory assistance accompany ketamine given IV for anesthesia.
The method of pulse radiolysis was used to generate reagents in situ in times (500 ns to 1.5 mus) short compared with the rates of the observed biochemical processes. This "instant" mixing technique is compared with rapid stopped flow measurements (limited in rates and concentrations) and T-jump measurements (limited to relaxation in the neighborhood of equilibrium) for the ferro-ferricytochrome c (C(II)-C(III))/ferro-ferricyanide (FCN(II)-FCN(III)) system. The reagents generated in situ were C(II) or FCN(III). Kinetically indistinguishable binding sites exist on C(II) and C(III) for hexacyanide anions. Reductive electron transfer to the protein proceeds within the FCN(II)-C(III) complex, with a rate of 400 s-1. The binding of FCN(II) on C(II) slows down the oxidation of C(II) by FCN(III). The sites of interaction on C(II) or C(III) with FCN(III) show effective charges of approximately +2. The association constant per binding site derived from the kinetics of electron transfer is greater than or equal to 10(4) M-1 for FCN(II)-C(II) and less than or equal to 10(4) M-1 for FCN(III)-C(III). Specific clusters of amino acids in the model of cytochrome C are suggested as binding sites. The oxidation-reduction reactions of FCN appear to involve electron equivalent transfer to and from such somewhat remote binding sites on the protein. Anions such as phosphate or sulphate also bind to these, less strongly than hexacyanides. In the presence of perchlorate the kinetics show the resolution of the pK=9.3 of C(III) into two parts: (a) optical changes at 695 nm due to ligand interchange on the heme-iron, unaffected by perchlorate and (b), a kinetic change leading to biphasic oxidation of C(II), with pK=7.4. This is attributed to the effect of perchlorate on water structure in the close environment of the binding sites. The high rate of oxidation of relaxed C(II) by FCN(III), (2 X 10(8) M-1 S-1 at mu=0) is not in agreement with an outer sphere Marcus mechanism. Nonrelaxed C(II) having a structure closer to C(III) transfers electron to FCN(III) even faster (k=3 X 10(9) M-1 S-1 at mu=0).
Thirty-five patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis were treated in a double-blind comparative trial in and East London Group Practice with either beclomethasone dipropionate (50 micrograms in each nostril four times a day) or a placebo aerosol preparation identical in appearance. There was a statistically significant difference in favour of intranasal beclomethasone dipropionate (P less than 0-05).
In vitro studies performed on rat submaxillary gland slices with diphenylhydantoin (6 X 10(-6) M) showed that variations of extracellular pH (pHe) had no significant effects on uptake and only slight effects on efflux (lowering the pHe slightly decreased efflux rates, whereas increasing pHe slightly increased efflux rates). Increasing diphenylhydantoin concentration significantly decreased uptake and slightly increased the rate of efflux. Uptake of 14C-diphenylhydantoin was significantly decreased when compared to control conditions (pH 7.40, 37 degrees C, 100% O2 aeration, 6 X 10(-6) M) by the following alterations: aeration of the incubation medium with N2 instead of O2, decrease of bath temperature from 37 degrees C to 5 degrees C and addition of the following metabolic inhibitors: iodoacetic acid (10(-3)M), 2,4-dinitrophenol (10(-3)M) and cyanide (10(-3)M). Probenecid (10(-3)M) had no significant effect on diphenylhydantoin uptake when compared to control values. No evidence of salivary biotransformation of diphenylhydantoin was seen in the in vitro system using thin-layer chromatography. These in vitro data suggest an active transport process that is concentration-dependent with a possible saturable binding site on the membrane or in the interior of the cell.
1. Phospholipase D [EC 3.1.4.4] from Streptomyces hachijoensis was purified about 570-fold by column chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and Sephadex G-50 followed by isoelectric focusing. 2. The purified preparation was found to be homogeneous both by immunodiffusion and polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis. 3. The isoelectric point was found to be around pH 8.6 and the molecular weight was about 16,000. 4. The enzyme has maximal activity at pH 7.5 at 37 degrees. The optimal temperature is around 50 degrees at pH 7.5, using 20 min incubation. 5. The enzyme was stable at 50 degrees for 90 min. At neutral pH, between 6 and 8, the enzyme retained more than 95% of its activity on 24 hr incubation at 25 degrees. However, the enzyme lost 80% of its activity under the same conditions at pH 4.0. 6. The enzyme was stimulated slightly by Ca2+, Mn2+, and Co2+, and significantly by Triton X-100 and ethyl ether. It was inhibited by Sn2+, Fe2+, Fe3+, Al3+, EDTA, sodium dodecyl sulfate, sodium cholate, and cetylpyridinium chloride. 7. This phospholipase D hydrolyzes phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, cardiolipin, sphingomyelin, phosphatidylserine, and lysophosphatidylcholine, liberating the corresponding bases. 8. The Km value was 4mM, determined with phosphatidylethanolamine as a substrate.
A protein has been studied which spontaneously precipitates from stored fractions of platelet soluble phase prepared by density gradient centrifugation. It is rich in a Ca2+ ATPase activity which displays an activity/pH profile resembling that of skeletal muscle myosin. Adjustment of freshly prepared soluble phase fractions to 0.6 M with respect to KCl and dilution 1 in 3 results in the precipitations of a protein fraction with essentially the same enzymatic properties as the spontaneously precipitable protein. These two similar proteins represent between 9 and 13% of the soluble phase total protein and each account for almost the whole of divalent cation activated ATPase activity of the soluble phases from which they were derived. The Mg2+ ATPase activity is only about twice purified with respect to the soluble phase enzyme activity, but the Ca2+ ATPase shows a 10-13-fold enrichment. Synthetic actomyosins can be prepared from the two proteins by addition of either platelet or skeletal muscle actin. These show significant increases in Mg2+ ATPase at the most favourable combination ratios. The ratio between the yield of soluble phase protein obtained by dilution precipitation and the lactate dehydrogenase activity of the soluble phase remains constant under a wide range of homogenization and sonication conditions applied to the original whole platelet suspensions. This confirms our earlier view that the soluble phase is a valid intracellular compartment for a considerable proportion of the platelet contractile protein and that in the complex the myosin-like component predominates.
Genetic analysis of 119 acetate non-utilizing (acu) mutants in Aspergillus nidulans revealed ten new loci affecting acetate metabolism in addition to the three previously recognized on the basis of resistance to fluoroacetate and acetate non-utilization. The enzyme lesions associated with mutations at seven of the acu loci are described. These are: facA (= acuA), acetyl-CoA synthase; acuD, isocitrate lyase; acuE, malate synthase; acuF, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; acuG, fructose 1,6-diphosphatase; acuK and acuM, malic enzyme. The acu loci have been mapped and are widely distributed over the genome of A. nidulans. Close linkage has only been found between acuA and acuD (less than 1% recombination). There is no evidence for any pleiotropic mutation in that region affecting the expression of both these genes. Poor induction of the enzymes of the glyoxylate cycle, isocitrate lyase and malate synthase in mutants lacking acetyl-CoA synthase, and also in the other two classes of fluoroacetate-resistant mutants, indicates that the inducer, acetate, may be metabolized to a true metabolic inducer, perhaps acetyl-CoA, to effect formation of the enzymes. There is no evidence of any other class of pleiotropic recessive acu mutations affecting the expression of the acuD and acuE genes, which are therefore thought to be subject to negative rather than positive control.
In the isolated preparation from the rabbit thoracic aorta, the affinities of the vasoconstrictor agents phenylephrine and histamine, as well as of the vasodilator beta-sympathomimetic drugs isoprenaline, fenoterol (TH 1165a), terbutaline, and salbutamol under the conditions of temperature increase, triiodothyronine and decrease of extracellular pH were investigated. It was observed that (1) a temperature increase from 25 degrees to 42 degrees C significantly indreased the maximal tension evoked by histamine, whereas that induced by the alpha-sympathomimetic drug phenylephrine was not altered significantly; the maximal relaxation caused by beta-sympathomimetic drugs either at 25 degrees or at 42 degrees C did not differ from one another; (2) the affinities of histamine, phenylephrine and of the beta-sympathomimetic drugs isoprenaline, fenoterol, terbutaline, and salbutamol each were comparable at either 25 degrees or 42 degrees C; the rank order of efficacy of the beta-sympathomimetic drugs is isoprenaline greater than fenoterol greater than salbutamol greater than terbutaline; (3) a decrease of the pH from 7.37 to 7.15 diminished the affinities of histamine and of the beta sympathomimetic drugs whereas that of the alpha-adrenergic drug phenylephrine was not altered. A further decrease of the pH to 6.8 diminished additionally the affinity of histamine and of isoprenaline, and especially that of the other beta-sympathomimetic drugs to such an extent that in the latter case complete dose-response curves could not be determined any more; (4) pretreatment of the animals with 0.4 mg/kg of triiodothyronine (T3) for two days, which strongly depressed the tension induced by either histamine or phenylephrine, did not alter the affinity of both drugs; T3 in vitro (10(-6) M) only diminished the affinity of histamine but left that of phenylephrine unaltered; pretreatment for two days with 0.2 mg/kg of T3 yielded a significant diminution of the pD2-values for two beta-sympathomimetic drugs investigated, namely isoprenaline and fenoterol; also the administration of T3 in vitro in a final concentration of 10(-6) M resulted in a diminution of the affinity of both beta-sympathomimetic drugs; (5) the results obtained show that also on the aorta beta-adrenoceptor stimulants are dependent on the metabolic state while alpha-adrenoceptor stimulants are not.
Pulmonary and cutaneous O2 consumption (Vo2) and CO2 production (Vco2) were measured simultaneously in bullfrogs Rana catesbeiana at 20 degrees C. The lungs were responsible for 77.3-91.0% of the total Vo2 and 28.5-74.9% of the total VCO2. The distribution of the total exchange between the lungs and skin depended on metabolic rate; frogs with higher rates relied more heavily on the pulmonary mode for both Vo2 and Vco2. When prevented from ventilating their lungs in an O2-rich environment, bullfrogs developed severe respiratory acidosis, demonstrating the importance of lung exchange in normal acid-base balance. When frogs were totally submerged in an O2-saturated medium, skin Vco2 increased linearly to a steady-state value which approximated the preapneic total Vco2. In these same animals, arterial Pco2 increased proportionately to the increase in skin Vco2, indicating that skin diffusion capacity for CO2 was unaffected. We conclude that the control of breathing in the bullfrog in response to changes in metabolic rate relies predominantly on changes in lung ventilation while the skin plays a more passive role.
The frequency of blood inhalation has been examined by the authors in the 15 years' material of the Institute of Forensic Medicine of the "Semmelweis" University Medical School. Out of 51.308 post mortem examinations 487 cases of isolated basicranial fractures were found. Out of them in 265 cases (=54%) blood inhalation as cause of death was verified. Attention is called to the importance of prompt blood aspiration in patients with basicranial fracture.
Lethal midline granuloma is a non-specific clinical term used for different pathological entities often exhibiting some semblance to each other as they lie along a histological spectrum. Nevertheless, each entity has a specific diagnostic pattern. The histological picture with distinguishing features of each specific type is pointed out. Stress is made on the use of repeated biopsy until the specific histological diagnosis can be made so that specific treatment as breifly outlined, can be carried out to insure the best prognosis.
Analgesic nephropathy occurs most commonly in Australia, where it is the second most frequent cause of renal failure. Whilst the reasons for widespread abuse of analgesics are poorly understood, the consequences of abuse are now well recognised. Increasing emphasis is being placed on the analgesic syndrome and on the accelerated atherosclerosis seen in these patients. Attention in the article is drawn to ways in which the analgesic syndrome can be recognised and analgesic abuse ceased. A therapeutic approach is presented which allows the successful withdrawal of analgesic in almost all patients.
The mechanism of action of quinidine on squid axons has been examined by means of voltage clamp and internal perfusion techniques. When applied either externally or internally, quinidine HCl suppresses both sodium and potassium conductance increases, the effect on the former accounting for the observed decrease in action potential. The potassium conductance in quinidine undergoes a marked inactivation in a manner dependent upon the membrane potential and time, accounting for the observed prolongation of the terminal falling phase of the action potential. Quinidine methiodide exhibits the effect similar to that of quinidine HCl only when applied internally. The dissociation constants of quinidine in suppressing the sodium conducting system are estimated to be 2.4 x 10(-4) and 4.0 x 10(-4) M for quinidine HCl and methiodide, respectively. The dissociation constant of quinidine in suppressing the potassium-conducting system decreases with increasing step depolarization. When applied externally to the intact axons, quinidine HCl is more effective at external pH 8.6 than at 7.3. When perfused internally, quinidine HCl is more effective at internal pH 7.0 than at 8.0, and the potency is related to the calculated internal concentration of the charged form rather than that of the uncharged form. These results lead to the conclusion that quinidine HCl penetrates the nerve membrane in the uncharged form, is ionized in the axon and blocks the sodium and potassium conductances primarily in the charged form. Thus, quinidine and local anesthetics share some features in the terms of the site of action and active form.
Complement-requiring neutralizing antibodies to herpes simplex type 1 virus (HSV 1) in titres from 2 to greater than 16 were detected in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 47% senile patients with various forms of dementia, but in none of mentally retarded adolescents and adults suffering from various neurologidal diseases. Also the incidence of HSV 1 serum antibodies in elevated titres (larger than or equal to 512) was increased in senile demented patients (61%) as compared with persons in normal senium (31%), normal adults (15%), mentally retarded adolescents (17%) and prisoned felons with low IQ (45-47%).
Using stereotaxic procedures, we electrically stimulated specific sites in the hypothalamus and midbrain of anesthetized dogs pretreated with guanethidine and atropine methonitrate. A tract in which stimulation caused noncholinergic dilator responses in the hindlimbs was identified. The course of this trace was different from that subserving cholinergic vasodilation in the hindlimb musculature. In a number of experiments we studied the proportional distribution of blood flow to leg and paw. Responses restricted to the paw were regarded as occurring mainly in cutaneous vessels; those restricted to the leg were regarded as occurring mainly in the skeletal muscle vessels. Some dilator responses in both beds were abolished by intra-arterial administration of antihistamines: other dilator responses were abolished by intra-arterial injections of dopamine antagonists. Centrally evoked dilation of leg and paw vessels by noncholinergic pathways suggests physiological roles for these fibers in the regulation of cardiovascular function.
Hypocapnia during extracorporeal circulation in hypothermia increases oxygen consumption. Po2 in mixed venous blood decreases. This probably reflects a decrease in tissue oxygen tension. Hyperventilation will therefore increase the risk of hypoxia in critically perfused tissues. Therefore we recommend to keep PaCO2 (T) constant at 40 mm Hg during hypothermia.
The electron transfer in the photosynthetic membrane of green plants from H2O to NADP+ is driven by two chlorophyll reaction centers in series. The electron transfer converts one part of the light energy into the form of the reducing power of NADPH. The transfer initiates an electrical field across the membrane. The electrical energy of the charged membrane is an additional state into which light energy is converted. Protolytic reactions coupled with the electron transfer lead to a proton translocation into the inner space of the thylakoid. The discharging of the ectrically energized membrane by H+ efflux is coupled with the formation of ATP.
Highly purified platelet glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD; D-glucose-6-phosphate:NADP+ 1-oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.49) can be modified in its isoelectric point and its molecular specific activity by extracts of some leukemic granulocytes. The "G6PD modifying factors" are relatively small molecules (molecular weight slightly under 5000), thermostable, dialyzable, and ultrafilterable. These molecules are destroyed by various endo- and exopeptidases and by serine enzymes present in crude extracts of leukocytes and commercial preparations of ribonuclease. The alterations of platelet G6PD due to the "G6PD modifying factors" are stable and not reversible by dialysis or further chromatography. The leukemic extracts which are able to modify G6PD also can modify the electrophoretic mobility and (or) the enzymatic activity of purified leukocyte pyruvate kinase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, and glucosephosphate isomerase. The chemical nature of such modifications and their relationships with post-translational modifications which occur in leukemic or normal cells are discussed.
Several hypotheses have been put forward to explain postdialysis hypocapnia. Three were tested in this study: impairment of tissue oxygenation by dialysis (D)-induced alkalosis (Bohr effect), the D disequilibrium syndrome, and the loss of carbon dioxide  (CO2) in D fluid. In 17 patients pre-DPCO2 was significantly correlated with plasma bicarbonate concentration (HCO3) and no disproportionate reduction of PCO2 was discernible. In 10 patients using a bath acetate concentration of 38 mEq/1 PCO2 was unchanged after D (35.4 versus 35.9 mm Hg before D), and was low relative to HCO3 whic increased from 21.2 to 28.0 mEq/1. After a dialysis using an acetate concentration of 25 mEq/1 HCO3 remained constant (20.4 versus 21.1 mEq/1 pre-D), whereas PCO2 fell from 35.3 to 30.8 mm Hg (P less than 0.001). Consequently PCO2 was again low relative to HCO3. Removal of CO2 by D fluid was excluded as a cause for low blood PCO2: addition of gaseous CO2 to the bath had no influence on arterial blood gases. Since post-D hypocapnia was not prevented when HCO3 was kept constant, it was concluded that post-D alkalosis cannot be the main reason for post-D hyperventilation, and that other factors related to the process of D are responsible.
Although a sulfate-reducing pathway in Escherichia coli involving free sulfite and sulfide has been suggested, it is shown that, as in Chlorella, a pathway involving bound intermediates is also present. E. coli extracts contained a sulfotransferase that transferred the sulfonyl group from a nucleosidephosphosulfate to an acceptor to form an organic thiosulfate. This enzyme was specific for adenosine 3'-phosphate 5'-phosphosulfate, did not utilize adenine 5'-phosphosulfate, and transferred to a carrier molecule that was identical with thioredoxin in molecular weight and amino acid composition. In the absence of thioredoxin, only very low levels of the transfer of the sulfo group to thiols was observed. As in Chlorella, thiosulfonate reductase activity that reduced glutathione-S-SO3- to bound sulfide could be detected. In E. coli, this enzyme used reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate and Mg2+, but did not require the addition of ferredoxin or ferredoxin nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate reductase. Although in Chlorella the thiosulfonate reductase appears to be a different enzyme from the sulfite reductase, the E. coli thiosulfonate reductase and sulfite reductase may be activities of the same enzyme.
Experiments were carried out on the isolated papillary muscle of the rabbit in order to further characterize the alpha-adrenoceptors mediating the positive inotropic effect. For this purpose dose-response relations of seven sympathomimetic amines were compared under the influence of alpha- and/or beta-adrenolytic drugs. Phentolamine (10(-6) M) shifted the lower part of the dose-response curves for norfenephrine, synephrine and epinine as for phenylephrine and adrenaline to the right, while prindolol (10(-8) M) affected only the upper part of the curves. In the presence of both alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents the entire dose-response curves for sympathomimetic amines were shifted in a parallel manner. Noradrenaline affected preferentially beta-adrenoceptors, whereas its effect on alpha-adrenoceptors was so weak that it could be detected only when the neuronal and extraneuronal uptake mechanism of amines were blocked by cocaine (3 X 10(-5) M) and corticosterone (4 X 10(-5) M), respectively. The effect of dopamine was not affected either by phentolamine or by prindolol, but was antagonized by the simultaneous application of both alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents. From the present results, it appears that the following relationships are present between the structure of amines and the alpha-adrenoceptor stimulating activity in the heart: (1) N-methylation increases the potency: (2) Absence of the hydroxyl group either in 3 or in 4 position decreases the intrinsic and beta-adrenoceptor stimulating activities, but increases the alpha-adrenoceptor stimulating activity.
Plasma renin activity (PRA) was measured in 38 cases of aortitis syndrome. The values of resting peripheral vein blood PRA were 32.2 +/- 4.2 (SE) mmug/ml. These values were 3 times higher than those of normal subjects. Hypertension due to renal arterial stenosis was observed in 18 cases. Their resting PRA values were 41.2 +/- 6.0 mmug/ml, while in the remaining 20 patients without renovascular hypertension those values were 24.2 +/- 5.4 mmug/ml. The patients belonging to aortic arch type or extensive type had 2 times higher PRA values than those of abdominal type. The patients with stenosis or obstruction of common carotid arteries had significantly higher PRA values than the patients without these lesions. Hyperresponse of renin secretion to upright posture was also observed in the same patients with carotid artery stenosis. Abnormal renin release in Takayasu's arteritis disappeared after denervation of the carotid sinus nerve. The present study suggests that the unstable state of carotid sinus reflex is the main cause for the hypersecretion of renin.
The etioplasts of dark-grown bean leaves showed ATPase (adenosine triphosphatase) activity which had a pH optimum of 8.5, was stimulated by dithiothreitol and unaffected by light-triggering. Bean chloroplasts showed a low activity of dark-induced ATPase with a pH optimum of 8.5 and a substantial amount of light-triggered activity with a pH optimum of 8.0. The light-triggered activity depended on dithiothreitol and Mg2+ and was promoted by phenazine methosulphate. Light-triggered ATPase activity was completely inhibited by 20mum-dicyclohexylcarbodi-imide. Etioplasts developed light-triggered ATPase activity in response to 30 min illumination of the etiolated leaves. During the 48 h of light-induced greening of dark-grown leaves there was a 70% increase of the chloroplast ATPase activity found after light-triggering and a 30% fall in the dark-induced activity, both expressed on a per leaf basis. As the larger part of these changes occurred during the first 30 min of illumination, it is concluded that most or all of the chloroplast ATPase was present in the etioplast, a conclusion identical with that of Lockshin et al. (1971) for maize. During 48 h of greening there was a tenfold increase in the amount of thylakoid membrane in the leaf together with an 83% fall in the ATPase activity per m2 of thylakoid membrane, measured after light-triggering.
It is generally believed that the reduction in plasma [HCO3] characteristic of chronic hypocapnia results from renal homeostatic mechanisms designed to minimize the alkalemia produced by.the hypocapneic state. To test this hypothesis, we have induced chronic hypocapnia in dogs in which plasma [HCO3] had previously been markedly reduced (from 21 to 15 meq/liter) by the prolonged feeding of HCl. The PaCO2 of chronically acid-fed animals was reduced from 32 to 15 mm Hg by placing the animials in a large environmental chamber containing 9% oxygen. In response to this reduction in PaCO2, mean plasma [HCO3] fell by 8.6 meq/liter, reaching a new steady-state level of 6.4 meq/liter. This decrement in plasma [HCO3] is almost identical to the 8.1 meq/liter decrement previously observed in normal (nonacid-fed) animals in which the same degree of chronic hypocapnia had been induced. Thus, in both normal and HCl-fed animals, the renal response to chronic hypocapnia causes plasma [HCO3] to fall by approximately 0.5 meq/liter for each millimeter of Hg reduction in CO2 tension. By contrast, the response of plasma [H+] in the two groups was markedly different. Instead of the fall in [H+] which is seen during chronic hypocapnia in normal animals, [H+] in HCl-fed animals rose significantly from 53 to 59 neq/liter (pH 7.28-7.23). This seemingly paradoxical response is, of course, an expression of the constraints imposed by the Henderson equation and reflects the fact that the percent fall in [HCO3] in the HCl-fed animals was greater than the percent fall in PaCO2. These findings clearly indicate that in chronic hypocapnia the kidney cannot be regarded as the effector limb in a homeostatic feedback system geared to the defense of systemic acidity.
We adapted the p-hydroxybenzoic acid hydrazide procedure for serum glucose for use with the Technicon SMA 12/60 AutoAnalyzer. Like the o-toluidine method, this method is based on a general carbohydrate reaction except that it occurs in a mildly alkaline medium and the intense yellow color formed is measured at 400 nm. Advantages of this reagent over o-toluidine include lower cost, less toxicity, and higher purity. Aside from those carbohydrates that are present in serum in insignificant quantities, there are no interferences from various physiological compounds or drugs (hypoglycemic agents) found either in normal persons or diabetics. Within-run and day-to-day values had coefficients of variation of 1.39% and 3.44%, respectively; recoveries ranged from 100 to 102% (mean, 101%). Comparative data showed excellent agreement with the hexokinase (r equals 0.998; y equals 0.950x + 5.91) and glucose oxidase (r equals 0.996; y equals 0.986x + 5.34) enzymatic ("true") glucose methods, and with the o-toluidine procedure (r equals 0.998; y equals 0.979x + 3.14).
A mixed bacterial culture, consisting of a minimum of nine isolates, was adapted to growth on technical parathion (PAR) as a sole carbon and energy source. The primary oxidative pathway for PAR metabolism involved an initial hydrolysis to yield diethylthiophosphoric acid and p-nitrophenol. A secondary oxidative pathway involved the oxidation of PAR to paraoxon and then hydrolysis to yield p-nitrophenol and diethylphosphoric acid. Under low oxgen conditions PAR was reduced via a third pathway to p-aminoparathion and subsequently hydrolyzed to p-aminophenol and diethylthiophosphoric acid. PAR hydrolase, an enzyme produced by an isolate from the mixed culture, rapidly hydrolyzed PAR and paraoxon (6.0 mumol/mg per min). This enzyme was inducible and stable at room temperature and retained 100% of its activity when heated for 55 C for 10 min.
The in vitro and in vivo liberation of acetylsalicylic acid from sustained release tablets in presence of ethanol is described. Simultaneous uptake of 120 ml commercial brandy resulted in a faster release of the active substance from the tablets prepared with Eudragit ret-l (PM), as has been proved by urinary excretion data. These results were supported by experiments with a pH-endoaradio transmitter and by radiography.
The modified procedure for rabbit skeletal muscle phosphofructokinase (PFK) purification is worked out utioizing the method of specific elution from DEAE-cellulose in 0.1 M tris-EDTA-phosphate pH 8.0 with 10 mM citrate. By the latter procedure PFK can be resolved into fractions A, B and C which are eluted specifically, with 0.3 M buffer and with 1.5 M NaCl respectively. Rechromatography of each fraction reveals their interconvertibility. The preparations are characterized by disc electrophoresis and velocity sedimentation. The results of formalinization experiments demonstrate that high concentrations of formaldehyde dissociate PFK u to the 5.3 S component. The presence of the 19.3 S component in the formalinized preparations evidences against the possibility that the middle component, presented at the schlieren patterns of PFK at pH 8.0, is and artifact of superposition. Complex profiles of protein distribution observed in different transport experiments are discussed from the point of view of slow equilibrium of oligomers and conformers characteristic to PFK over the pH range from 6 to 9.
Various cell lines were infected with virulent and attenuated strains of pseudorabies virus (PRV). According to the type of the cytopathic effect (CPE), the cells could be divided into 3 groups: cells in which all strains formed syncytia; cells in which all strains caused rounding of cells; and cells in which virulent strains caused syncytium formation while attenuated ones rounding of cells. Neither the form (fibroblastoid or epithelial) nor the origin of cells influenced the type of the CPE. L cells and some cell lines derived from human tissue proved to be less sensitive to PRV than other cells. In certain human cells (e.g. HeLa and D6) virulent PRV strains propagated better than attenuated ones.
The preponderance of evidence indicates that sodium monofluorophosphate exerts a highly beneficial effect on dental caries incidence and enamel solubility. Optimal effects are obtained with a concentration of 4 X 10(3) ppm fluoride, by a four-minute application and by adjusting the pH to 4.0. The reaction of sodium monofluorophosphate with enamel is not temperature dependent. Sodium monofluorophosphate is significantly more protective than sodium fluoride in aqueous solutions at all equivalent fluoride concentrations and in pastes at concentrations exceeding 8 X 10(3) ppm fluoride.
1. A particulate enzyme fraction and an acetone powder preparation from cucumber fruits cleaved 9- and 13-hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acids to form volatile aldehydes and oxoacid fragments. 2. From the 9-hydroperoxide, the major volatile fragments were cis-3-nonenal and trans-2-nonenal using particulate enzyme and acetone powder preparations, respectively. 3. Hexanal was the only significant volatile fragment from the 13-hydroperoxide. 4. The particulate enzyme system was equally effective on both 9- and 13-hydroperoxide isomers and was fully active under anaerobic conditions and at pH 6.4. 5. An enzymic pathway for the biogenesis of hexanal, cis-3- and trans-2-nonenal (components of the characteristic flavour volatiles of cucumber) from linoleic acid is proposed. This involves the sequential activity of lipoxygenase, hydroperoxide cleavage and cis-3-: trans-2-enal isomerase enzymes.
Takayasu-Onishi arteritis (T.O.) is similar to Hutchison-Horton arteritis (H.H.) on histological, clinical, laboratory, and pathogenetic grounds. Both probably depend on immunitary dysreactivity, their different clinical expression being attributable to differences in the district involved and the age of the subject. Both are preceded or accompanied by rheumatism. An interesting relation can be made out between temporal arteritis and "rheumatic polymyalgia" or, more aptly, "rhizomelic polymyalgia" (Ballabio, 1975). The latter (of rheumatic origin) may accompany arteritis - Hamrin, indeed, has suggested their unification in the description "arteritic polymyalgia". It is uncertain whether vasculopathy in the course of collagen disease, rheumatic arteritis, and polyarteritis nodosa can be identified with T.O., even though a common immunological basis can be made out. The difference between T.O. and thromboangiitis obliterans, on the other hand, is quite clear at the present time.
The response of human erythrocytes to cholinergic ligands was studied with an electron spin resonance assay. The membrane response to carbamyl choline was found to be antagonized by atropine and, in the absence of calcium, by tetrodotoxin. Experiments with resealed ghosts showed that the membrane response to carbamyl choline required ATP and calcium. Reductive alkylation of intact cells eliminated the cholinergic response, but the presence of saturating amounts of carbamyl choline protected the putative receptor against inactivation. Affinity labeling was used to demonstrate an apparent molecular weight of 41,000 for the carbamyl choline-binding species. A lipid vesicle extraction technique was used to induce a specific cation permeability defect in intact cells. Preliminary investigation of this phenomenon is described.
Hormone-sensitive lipase and cholesterol ester hydrolase of chicken adipose tissue were markedly activated by adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase (on the average, 235 to 275%; occasionally as much as 1000%). Diglyceride and monoglyceride hydrolases were also activated, but to a lesser extent (60 to 87%). The activation of all four hydrolases was inhibited by protein kinase inhibitor and reversed by the addition of exogenous protein kinase. Following activation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase, all four hydrolases were deactivated in a Mg2+-dependent reaction and then reactivated to or near initial levels on incubation with cAMP and Mg2+-ATP. The reversible deactivation is assumed to reflect activity of one or more protein phosphatases. The maximum activation obtainable for the four hydrolases decreased when the tissue had been previously exposed to glucagon, indicating that the glucagon-induced activation was probably similar to or identical with the activation demonstrated in cell-free preparations. The pH optima for the four hydrolase activities were similar (7.13 to 7.38). Although the absolute activities and relative degrees of kinase activation differed according to the particular emulsified substrates used, the results do not rule out the possibility that all four hydrolase activities are referable to a single hormone-sensitive hydrolase. Hormone-sensitive acyl hydrolases were separated from lipoprotein lipase by heparin-Sepharose affinity chromatography. Lipoprotein lipase was active against triolein, diolein, and monoolein, but not cholesterol oleate. Incubation of lipoprotein lipase with exogenous protein kinase, cAMP, and Mg2+ATP had no effect on any of the three hydrolase activities. Lipoprotein lipase was further purified to homogeneity and used to prepare antiserum in rabbits. The immunoglobin G fraction from these antisera completely inhibited lipoprotein lipase eluted from heparin-Sepharose columns. However, the hormone-sensitive hydrolase activities (not retained on heparin-Sepharose affinity chromatography) were not inhibited by anti-lipoprotein lipase immunoglobin G, and anti-lopoprotein lipase immunoglobin G did not affect the activation process in crude fractions. Thus, hormone-sensitive lipase and lipoprotein lipase, functionally distinct enzymes, have been physically resolved and immunochemically distinguished. Apparently lipoprotein lipase activity is not regulated, at least directly, by cAMP-dependent protein kinase.
Evidence is presented that the enzymes catalyzing the three reactions involved in urea cleavage in Candida utilis, biotin carboxylation, urea carboxylation, and allophanate hydrolysis occur as a complex of enzymes. The allophanate-hydrolyzing activity could not be separated from the urea-cleaving activity using common methods of protein purification. Further, urea cleavage and allophanate hydrolysis activities are induced coordinately in cells grown on various nitrogen sources. The reactions involved in urea cleavage can be distinguished from one another on the basis of their sensitivities to (a) heat, (b) pH, and (c) chemical inhibitors. Evidence is presented for the product of the first reaction in urea cleavage, biotin carboxylation. Production of carboxylated enzyme is ATP dependent and avidin sensitive. Carboxylated enzyme is not observed in the presence of 1 mM urea.
A chromatin-bound protease, active in 2 M NaCl-5 M urea or 5 M urea alone, was demonstrated in rat liver, kidney, testes, brain, rabbit bone marrow, chicken reticulocyte, and Ehrlich ascites chromatin. Chicken erythrocyte chromatin did not possess any detectable proteolytic activity in salt and urea. The proteolytic activity of rat liver chromatin in salt and urea was found to be independent of the methods of chromatin preparation. The protease can be inhibited by the serine specific reagents phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and diisopropyl fluorophosphate and the alkylating reagent, carbobenzoxyphenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, in the presence of organic solvents at 1 mM concentration. The inhibitions of chromatin-bound protease in rat liver by these compounds are irreversible. On the other hand, carbobenzoxyphenylalanine and p-nitrophenyl acetate were shown to be reversible inhibitors of rat liver chromatin-bound protease. The application of these inhibitors during the dissociation of chromatin by salt and urea may be useful to researchers interested in purifying various chromosomal proteins or to those researchers doing reconstitution studies with labile chromatins.
The author shows complex analyses: clinical, laboratory, X-rays, bronchoscopical, bronchographical and measuring lung function tests as well as the serological examinations in blood serum of both groups of asthmatic and nonasthmatic children with virological infection. The calculation of statistically significant differences between the various diagnostical results of both groups has confirmed that in asthmatic children virological infection of the respiratory tract, pathological findings in X-ray and lung function tests, bronchiectasis and secondary bacteriological invasion occurs statistically significantly more often than in nonasthmatic children.
D-Lactate dehydrogenase has been purified to near homogeneity from Peptostreptococcus elsdenii. As isolated, the enzyme contains flavine adenine dinucleotide and a tightly bound metal cofactor. Inactivation by ortho-phenanthroline occurs in two steps and is partially blocked by D-lactate. Reactivation by divalent metal ions occurs, with divalent zinc being the most effective. When ferricyanide is used as the electron acceptor, D-lactate has an apparent K0.5 of 3.3 M0.46; its binding is negatively cooperative with a Hill coefficient of 0.46. Replacement of ferricyanide by the other components of the electron transport system yields hyperbolic kinetics with an apparent Km for D-lactate of 26 mM. The apparent Km for ferricyanide is 2.2 X 10(-4) M. Phosphate and pyrophosphate compounds stimulate the D-lactate:ferricyanide activity. These properties suggest that interaction of this enzyme with other electron transport proteins in the chain may enhance D-lactate binding and, hence, the rate of electron transport.
The lag period preceding germination of Streptomyces viridochromogenes spores during incubation in a defined germination medium was completely eliminated by a gentle heat shock. The rate of germination was not affected. The optimum pH for activation extended from 6.0 to 9.6. The time of heating required for maximum activation was 1 min at 60 C, 2 to 5 min at 55 C, 20 min at 50 C, and 40 to 50 min at 45 C. Activated spores had the same temperature and pH optima and nutritional requirements for germination as unactivated spores. Activated spores deactivated during incubation for 8 h at 25 C and were activated again by a second heat shock. Spores that had been aged for 4 weeks or longer did not germinate in the defined germination medium unless they were first heat activated.
The red azoTyr-248-Zn complex of arnilazocarboxypeptidase, previously used to demonstrate differences in conformation of the enzyme in crystals and in solution, has now provided means to detect multiple conformations of the enzyme in solution by stopped-flow pH and temperature jump experiments. These studies identify two distinct processes. Er + H+ in equilibrium Ey (I), is the extremely rapid, Kfast about 10(5) sec-1, pH dependent dissociation of the metal complex. Ey in equilibrium Ey' (II), is much slower, Kslow about 5 sec-1, pH independent interconversion of two distinct populations of protein molecules, Ey and Ey', in which the yellow azo-Tyr-248 is different conformations. These two conformations can be differentiated readily by stopped-flow pH-jump experiments, since I is three to four orders of magnitude faster than II. Mathematical expressions derived from this mechanism accurately predict all observations over the pH range from 6.0 to 8.5. In a previous stopped-flow pH-jump experiment, Lipcomb and coworkers [Quiocho, F. A., McMurray, C. H. & Lipcomb, W. H. (1972), Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 69, 2850-2854] recognized only a single process with a rate constant of about 6 sec-1, but not the major, very rapid rate observed here. The failure to detect this fast process led to the postulation of a number of explanations intended to account for the detection of only a single, slow rate. The present observations show that the premise for those conjectures is not valid. The azoprobe reveals the existence of rapidly interconvertible substructures of carboxypeptidase A, and the results support the view that in solution, enzymes can adopt multiple, readily interconvertible and related conformations which could then either facilitate or impede catalysis. In crystals, rearrangement of molecular structure could be severely impaired or restricted, and crystallization might single out either active or inactive conformations. In the latter case, such crystals would have greatly reduced activities and markedly altered catalytic behavior, as is observed for carboxypeptidase A. In combination with detailed kinetic analysis of crystals, conformational analysis in solution should be a valuable guide to discern enzyme mechanisms and select crystals for x-ray structure analysis.
Certain climatic and edaphic conformations in the Bavarian sub-alpine mountains and in the Alps favor above all the development of a land utilization system and farm structures similar to those in the northern part of Scandinavia. In 1963/64, the years of the highest environmental contamination up to the present, we established in 600 beef samples from the round or shoulder of male and female cattle (mainly Highland cattle) close connections between the 137Cs-contamination of green crop and the long lastnig yearly precipitation quantities, as well as certain relations between the 137Cs-contamination of meat and differences in the feeding and keeping of the animals. During summer-seasons (April-October), beef of cattle from pastures with heavy rainfall (Alps) was contaiminated by 137Cs up to 15 times more than that of confined animals. Hereby the rate of 137Cs-contamination in the meat of grazing cattle was nearly proportional to the quantities of precipitation. When confined cattle were fed on pastures in autumn after harvesting for 2 to 3 weeks, a quick increase of 137Cs-contamination of the meat was caused within this time up to values which in this district were otherwise only observed in grazing cattle. The lower 137Cs-content in meat of cattle housed during the summer season is due to the more varied fodder, which is at that time less contaminated than green crop. During the winter season (November to March), the highest contaminations in the meat of confined (Bohemian Forest) or grazing cattle (Alps) was measured when the animals in these districts were almost exclusively fed with fodder from the own farmground or with leafy silage. The highest contamination was almost regularly noticed in January, February and March, as generally during these months the highly contaminated first cut hay is fed. Here the meat was often even more contaminated than that of grazing cattle. After the quick decrease of 137Cs in fallout noticed in the years 1964 and 1965, in 1965/66 a dependance in the 137Cs-contamination of beef on the methods of keeping and feeding could still be observed in only the extreme cases (Alps, Bavarian- and Bohemian Forest); though in general, meat of animals from districts with heavy rainfall was slightly more contaminated than meat of animals from regions with less precipitation.
The bicarbonate concentration in rat parotid saliva increases with increasing flow rates and approximates plasma values at highest salivation. At lowest flow rates the bicarbonate concentration in the secretory fluid markedly exceeds the plasma levels. Intravenous administration of acetazolamide has no influence on the bicarbonate excretion of the parotid gland. Following retrograde application of acetazolamide into the gland duct the concentrations of both bicarbonate and sodium are elevated. The potassium concentrations in final saliva exceed 70 mEq/l at flow rates below 5 mul/min g gland weight. With increasing flow rates a precipitous decrease in potassium concentration below 10 mEq/l occurs. With further increase in flow rate the potassium concentration remains unchanged. The sodium concentrations increased with augmented salivation rate. At lowest flow rates the sodium concentrations showed an increase of modest degree. Our findings can best be explained by the existence of two independent ductular mechanism: a) bicarbonate reabsorption probably in the striated ducts of the parotid gland; b) secretion of potassium with concomitand secretion of bicarbonate in the main excretory duct.
Loss of ascorbic acid from lung and pulmonary edema were produced in mice by intravenous injection of either adrenaline or noradrenaline (5 mumol/kg). While adrenalectomy performed before noradrenaline administration reduced the degree of pulmonary edema, a prior dose of hexamethonium accentuated this effect. Given alone, hexamethonium caused both loss of ascorbic acid and pulmonary edema. The results show that although endogenous catecholamines can potentiate the pulmonary edema produced by either adrenaline or noradrenaline, they play no specific role in the ascorbic acid loss. The evidence suggests that lung ascorbic acid levels are decreased following the development of pulmonary edema, irrespective of how it was caused.
Repeated oral treatment of male rats with piperazine-substituted phenothiazine drugs in doses of 25 mg/kg or more daily led to an accumulation of metabolites containing an ethylenediamine group instead of the piperazine ring. These products of ring degradation with and without removal of the N-alkyl group were found, together with the parent drugs and their N-dealkylated metabolites, in liver, lung, kidney, and spleen, as well as in brain when high doses were administered. After termination of treatment, the ethylenediamine derivatives were eliminated more slowly than were their congeners containing the intact piperazine ring. Parallel observations were made in dogs given fluphenazine in daily doses of up to 40 mg/kg. Quantitative differences were observed in the relative amounts of mono- and disubstituted ethylenediamine metabolites accumulated in rat tissues during treatment with the various drugs; the proportion of the monosubstituted product formed by N-dealkylation and ring cleavage declined in the following order: perazine, prochlorperazine, trifluoperazine, fluphenazine, perphenazine. Condensation products of the ethylenediamine derivatives with formaldehyde were split in the extraction procedure used.
Cellulase production and growth of a strain of Sporotrichum thermophile were studied by using a mineral salts medium supplemented with yeast extract and insoluble cellulose. The effects of cultural conditions, such as pH, nitrogen source, substrate concentration, and temperature, were examined. Maximum production of C1 and CX cellulases occurred at 45 C in 2 to 4 days, in the presence of 1% Solka/Floc as substrate, when NaNO3 or urea used as sources of nitrogen. Under these conditions, cellulolytic activity of culture filtrates appeared to be similar to that reported for Trichoderma viride grown in a favorable environment. However, comparable yields of cellulase were produced by S. thermophile in less than one-quarter the time required by mesophilic fungi.
By employing spectrofluorometry and quantitative fluorescent histochemistry the norepinephrine (NE) content in the tissue and in the adrenergic nerves of Vas deferens of the rat after depletion of the transmitter's reserves with tyramine and their subsequent replenishment through incubation of the tissue with exogenous NE was measured. The object of investigations was also the influence of antidepressants (phthoracizine and imipramine) and of the cholinolytic spasmolytin (diphacyl) on processes of the NE accumulation. Phthoracizine, impramine and spasmolytin were found to capable of inhibiting accumulation of the exogenous NE in the tissue and in the adrenergic nerves of Vas deferens, provided the mediator is present in the extraneuronal medium in a concentration of 0.5 gamma/ml. When the neurotransmitter was introduced into the medium in higher concentrations (10 gamma/ml) the antidepressents and cholinolytic did not produce the said effect. A correlation of spectrofluorometric and quantitative fluorescent-histochemical findings was observed in cases when the tissue contained less than 50% (i.e. less than 9 gamma/ml) of the total NE reserves.
The present study was designed to assess the effects of two beta-adrenergic agonists, isoproterenol sulfate and carbuterol hydrochloride, and aerosolized Freon propellant (a mixture of Freon II, Freon 12, and Freon 114) on tracheal mucous velocity and cardiac output in anesthetized dogs. Five groups of ten animals each received the following dosages of aerosols: Freon, 20 puffs; isoproterenol, four puffs; carbuterol, four puffs; isoproterenol, 20 puffs; and carbuterol, 20 puffs. The puff was delivered by a standard metered aerosol; each puff of isoproterenol spray contained 75 mug of isoproterenol sulfate, and each puff of carbuterol spray contained 100 mug of carbuterol hydrochloride. Tracheal mucous velocity was not changed by receiving Freon, but administration of both isoproterenol and carbuterol caused a significant increase in this measurement, with peak increases ranging from 74 to 111 percent above control values. The duration of action for four and 20 puffs of isoproterenol and for four puffs of carbuterol was two hours. Twenty puffs of carbuterol increased tracheal mucous velocity for three hours. Administration of carbuterol effected a slightly larger increase in cardiac output than isoproterenol. The duration of action for the increased cardiac output was shorter than the duration of action for the increased tracheal mucous velocity. These studies indicate that beta-adrenergic agonists may have an important role in improving mucous transport in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in whom mucociliary clearance is depressed.
Formulation studies have been conducted on an oxytetracycline dihydrate tablet formulation containing microcrystalline cellulose and alginic acid, wet granulated with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) solution. A range of granule properties including size, strength packing and porosity, and tablet properties including breaking load, porosity, disintegration and dissolution have been measured. Increased compaction pressure decreased tablet porosity. The reproducibility of the above properties was determined by tests on nine standard batches of granules and tablets. An increased concentration of PVP in the binder solution decreased the rate of tablet dissolution. Although the volume of granulating solution apparently controlled the granule size, it did not significantly alter the tablet dissolution, when the amount of PVP was constant.
The authors describe different properties of brain mitochondrial and cell sap alanine aminotransferase. They showed that the mitochondrial enzyme was inhibited by maleate, chlorides, acetate and phosphate with a high ionic strength (over 1.8), that its pH optimum lay between 7.5 and 8.5, that it was thermolabile at over 40 degrees C and that it was salted out from solutions with ammonium sulphate at 0.6--0.8 saturation. The activity of the cell sap enzyme was inhibited by phosphate at an ionic strength of only 0.12, less markedly by maleate and not at all by chlorides and acetate; its pH optimum was about 8, it was thermostable up to 60 degrees C and was precipitated from ammonium sulphate solution at between 0.35 and 0.6 saturation. The authors conclude from their results that two different alanine aminotransferase enzymes are present in the CNS.
Effects of 3 kinds of parasympatholytic drugs (timepidiumbromide, hyoscine-N-butylbromide and prifinium-bromide) and placebo (physiological saline solution) on the gastrointestinal tract were evaluated roentgenographically by double blind technique in a total of 101 male human subjects. The results may briefly be summarized as follows: 1. There were significant differences on hypotonic rate being one of the indexes of the gastric tonus between timepidium-bromide and placebo. The effects of 3 experimental drugs were significantly high as compared with that of placebo on peristaltic movement of the stomach. The effect of timepidium-bromide was significantly different from that of placebo on the site of arrival of barium. 2. The comparison of degrees of the gastric tonus between main and control tests revealed that the effect of placebo obtained in the main test was significantly inferior to that of hyoscine-N-butylbromide obtained in the control test, whereas there existed no significant differences of the effects among 3 active drugs. 3. Effects of each drug on the gastric tonus which was scored by hypertonic, normotonic and hypotonic state were evaluated by stratification. The result showed that the effect of timepidium-bromide was significantly greater than that of placebo. 4. All active drugs were not significantly different in terms of 7 observed values each on the gastric form.
Hepatic microsomal protein, cytochrome P-450, UDP-glucuronyltransferase, ethylmorphine demethylase, aniline hydroxylase, and aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase levels were measured in the 2-, 4-, 5-, 6-, and 8-month-old Hanford miniature pig. The activities or concentrations of all of the liver parameters measured had apparently reached their adult plateau level by 2 months of age. The use of the miniature pig in toxicology research programs is discussed.
D-Erythrulose reductase of beef liver was crystallized from ammonium sulfate solution at pH 8.17. The crystals are needle-shaped. The enzyme protein contains 851 amino acid residues per mole of the enzyme: Lys28, His11, Arg52, Asp79, Thr58, Ser56, Glu68, Pro20, Gly80, Ala107, Val112, Met24, Ile31, Leu88, Tyr7, Phe22, Trp4, and Cys4. The enzyme is inactivated by exposure to temperatures below 12degrees. The inactivation is accelerated by increasing the salt concentration and decreasing the enzyme concentration. The pH of the medium also has a pronounced effect, the maximum stability of the enzyme is obtained at pH 8.5. NADP+ protected the enzyme from cold inactivation at all stages of the process and also afforded protection against inactivation by heat and pH. The cold inactivation of the enzyme is accompanied by dissociation of the enzyme protein to subunits.
1. Cyclopentanone oxygenase from Pseudomonas NCIB 9872 has been purified some 40-fold. It gives a single peak in the ultracentrifuge and a single major protein band on polyacrylamide gels contaminated with about 5% of a slower migrating impurity. Flavin dissociates from the protein during electrophoresis. 2. The enzyme has a molecular weight of about 200000 and is a homopolymeric assemblage of either three of four subunits of molecular weight 54000-58000. 3. The prosthetic group is FAD and values of about 2.5 are typically obtained for the number of moles bound to each mole of holoenzyme. Some FAD probably dissociates during purification and it seems likely that each subunit binds one FAD in the undamaged protein.
An intracellular invertase was induced in cultures of Clostridium pasteurianum utilizing sucrose as its carbon source for growth. This enzyme synthesis could be repressed by the addition of fructose of a sucrose-growing culture. In contrast, invertase activity was not affected by the addition of glucose to sucrose-growing cells and this enzyme could be induced in a glucose-metabolizing culture by the addition of sucrose. This enzyme was purified 10.5-fold over the induced lese, EC 3.2.1.26) by substrate-specificity studies. Invertase had a pH optimum of 6.5 and an apparent Km of 79.5 mM for sucrose, and required high concentration of potassium phosphate for maximum activity. Invertase was completely inactivated by a 2-min heat treatment at 60 degrees C. This enzyme was strongly inhibited by p-hydroxymercuribenzoate (pCMB) and weakly inhibited by 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), while cysteine could substantially reverse pCMB) inhibition, suggesting that sulfhydryl group(s) were necessary for invertase activity.
On X-ray irradiated mice with a total dose of 800 R, the reactivity upon an aggressive agent (chloroform stress) administered at various delays after irradiation was studied. The reactivity of the animals has been emphasized by the hepatic induction of the tyrosine aminotransferase and by the adrenal ascorbic acid depletion. From the 3rd day after irradiation both these parameters showed a marked and irreversible decrease.
Vaginal epithelial cells from healthy women were washed and incubated in tissue culture medium with freshly isolated bacteria of the indigenous vaginal flora and with bacteria of species that have been discussed in conjunction with genital infections. After incubation and washing, the number of bacteria that adhered per cell was determined. The influence on the attachment rate of such factors as variations in the washing procedure, bacterial density, and incubation time was assessed. Lactobacillus acidophilus and other bacterial species that occur in the lower genital tract of healthy women, e.g., some strictly anaerobic species, adhered by significantly lower numbers per cell than Neisseria gonorrhoeae, group B streptococci, and Corynebacterium vaginale. Significantly more freshly isolated gonococci adhered per cell than gonococci that had been passaged on artificial medium. The adherence of gonococci increased with increasing acidity of the test medium.
In a random crossover study, ten healthy men were pretreated with ammonium chloride or sodium bicarbonate to alter urinary pH, and then were given a single 1-Gm dose of cephradine, either orally or intravenously. No significant changes were found in the terminal phase rate constant nor in the time or magnitude of peak concentration. Total recovery was greater than 90 per cent whenever degradation of cephradine did not occur. An unexplained but significant reduction in area under curve was present in data for prealkalinized subjects and for all subjects who took cephradine orally. Trapping of cephradine was not significant in the excretory pathway.
Our efforts have been directed towards characterizing amino acid uptake, metabolism and release in bulk-isolated glia and neuronal perikarya studied in parallel with nerve-endings, especially as it concerns the transmitter amino acids and the participation of glia in the clearing of the synpatic space during impulse conduction. A possible neuromodulator role for the glia at the synapse is also suggested by K+-stimulated release. Our most definitive conclusions have been based so far on studies with GABA, although we are also beginning to accumulate data for glutamate related to glutamate-glutamine compartmentation. Glia preferentially accumulate potassium and amino acids compared to neuronal perikarya, have higher Na+/K+-ATPase activity, possess high-affinity, sodium-dependent uptake systems for GABA and glutamate similar to the ones in synaptosomes, and release amino acid in response to a potassium pulse by a calcium-independent process. Low neuronal uptake could be due to loss of dendrites. Unidirectional GABA-flux from the synaptosomal to glial compartment is supported by high GAD in nerve endings compared to high GABA-T in glia. Glutamine may be a transmitter glutamate-precursor in nerve-endings since glutaminase activity is high in nerve-endings, but low in glia where glutamine is presumably made. Glutamine uptake in both glia and synaptosomes obeys low-affinity kinetics in contrast to glutamate, consistent with the inability of glutamine to excite the neuronal membrane. The studies with GABA, which are considerably more extensive, are supported by related work using glia in tissue-culture and autoradiography. There appears to be a suggested difference in the behavior of amines which were poorly taken up by the glial system. Glia, synaptosomes and neuronal perikarya, in general behaved similarly with respect to requirements for uptake and release, except in the case of Ca++, which exerted opposite effects on glial and synaptosomal uptake of GABA. We believe that work along these lines tends to firmly establish a direct role for glial cells as modulators of neuronal excitability and represents a convergence between transmitter amino acid neuropharmacology and cellular biochemistry. This not only deepens and enlarges the vocabulary of synaptic biochemistry but also undoubtedly will have major clinical applications in the fields of epilepsy and behavior.
The question of pH or flow dependence for the renal elimination of procainamide (PCA) was studied under 4 conditions in each of 4 subjects. Each subject received 500 mg of PCA intravenously at weekly intervals while in a state of (1) acid load (NH4Cl) and water deprivation, (2) acid load and water excess, (3) alkali load (NaHCO3) and water deprivation, and (4) alkali load and water excess. Plasma and urine were collected at frequent intervals for PCA and N-acetyl PCA (NAPA) analysis. Urine flow rates varied markedly between the water deprivation and water excess states (approximately 1.2 vs 5 ml/min, respectively), and urine pH varied markedly between the acid and alkali load states (pH = ca 5 vs 8, respectively). Despite this marked variation, there were no significant changes in PCA renal clearance or 24-hr PCA or NAPA excretion. If passive diffusion of PCA were taking place, such flow and pH changes would have caused marked changes in PCA clearance were the pH partition hypothesis true. We therefore conclude that passive diffusion is not an important mechanism in the renal elimination of PCA in man and that there must be tubular secretion. The implication for the clinical use of the drug is that dose adjustments need not be made in response to variations in urine flow and pH.
Homogeneous rabbit liver phosphorylase phosphatase (Brandt, H., Capulong, Z. L., and Lee, E. Y. C. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 8038-8044) also dephosphorylates glycogen synthase b. During purification, phosphorylase phosphatase and glycogen synthase phosphatase co-purified with a constant ratio of activities. The two activities co-migrated on disc gel electrophoresis. Both substrates competed with each other for the phosphatase, and both phosphatase activities were inhibited by lysine ethyl ester. It is concluded that liver phosphorylase phosphatase and glycogen synthase phosphatase have a common identity and that coordinate regulation of the phosphatase-catalyzed activation of glycogen synthase and inactivation of phosphorylase occurs in vivo. This provides a parallel and opposing mechanism to that mediated by adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate-dependent protein kinase, which coordinately inactivates glycogen synthase and, via phosphorylase kinase, activates phosphorylase. Maximal glycogen synthase phosphatase activity was observed near neutrality. Mg2+ and glucose-6-P activated the glycogen synthase phosphatase reaction and this activation was pH-dependent. The Km for glycogen synthase b was 0.12 muM.
Some LD50 determinations for tetracycline hydrochloride in mice were carried out over a range of pH values, using both the intraperitoneal and the subcutaneous routes of injection. Depending on the pH of the formulation, either water or a solvent system of water and 60% (v/v) propylene glycol was employed thus ensuring complete solution of the drug at all pH values tested. Higher LD50 values were obtained with the subcutaneous route than with the intraperitoneal route. With either route of administration, there was a trend toward lowest LD50 value occurrence at the isoelectric pH of tetracycline. Actual statistical significance was achieved for the intraperitoneal route only when LD50 values obtained at the isoelectric pH were compared with either of the more acidic pH values.
Some properties of rat skin benzoylarginine-2-naphthylamide hydrolase types I (preparations I and AI) and II (preparations II and NII) were studied. Both types were activated by dithiothreitol and EDTA, but responded differently to 1 mM KCN, when benzoylarginine-2-naphthylamide (BANA) was used as a substrate: type I was inhibited, while type II was activated. When leucine-2-naphthylamide was used as a substrate, both types were activated by KCN. Thiol proteinase inhibiting substances, like heavy metals, iodoacetic acid, 4-chloromercuribenzoic acid, and tosyllysine chloromethylketone, inhibited the enzymes. Diisopropylfluorophosphate, phenylmethylsulfonyfluoride, 4-aminobenzamidine, and high-molecular-weight trypsin inhibitors were without effect. The substrate specificity of rat skin BANA hydrolase resembled that of an amino acid naphthylamidase, naphthylamides of methionine, lysine, arginine, and alanine being hydrolyzed most rapidly. The rate of hydrolysis of BANA was only 11% of that of methionine naphthylamide. Amino acid esters with a free alpha-amino group were also good substrates. The transformation of type II to type I at acidic pH was studied. During the transformation amino acids or peptides were formed and probably some inhibitor present in type II was destroyed proteolytically.
Lipids are separated from dieldrin, endrin, and p,p'-DDE residues by saponification in ethanolic sodium hydroxide, acidification with dilute sulfuric acid, and adsorption chromatography on deactivated alumina, using petroleum ether as the eluant. Dieldrin, endrin, and p,p'-DDE are efficiently recovered (95-102%), and p,p'-DDT is converted to p,p'-DDE, which is then recovered with high yield (90-96%). Extremely low lipid carryover (less than 0.3-0.5%) is observed for 0.5-1.0 g samples of chicken fat.
Kinetic studies of ethanolaminephosphate-cytidylyltransferase (E.C. 2.7.7.14) from rat liver have been carried out in presence of structural analogues of ethanolaminephosphate : these compounds acted as inhibitors of the enzyme: - 2-aminoethylphosphonate behaved as a substrate and a competitive inhibitor to phosphorylethanolamine: the Km value of 2-aminoethylphosphonate was nearly the same as its Ki value, at pH = 5,5 (30 X 10(-3) M and 24 x 10(-3) M, respectively). - 3-aminopropylphosphonate was also a competitive inhibitor. It appeared to be the best inhibitor at pH optimum (pH = 7,7). - 1-aminoethylphosphonate behaved as a noncompetitive inhibitor. However, cytidylyltransferase was relatively specific, inhibitions being always weak. Inhibitory power of phosphonates was stimulated by Mg++.
Oral lesions caused by habits can be of teeth only, of teeth and the soft tissues of the mouth or may be only of the soft tissues. Lesions of teeth are permanent and may remain even when there has been total destruction of soft tissues. Recognition of lesions due to habits such as betel chewing, snuff dipping, pipe smoking and certain sexual practices may help towards establishing the sex, the ethnic grouping or even the place of origin of a person or their remains. Certain dental and gingival changes may indicate a person's working circumstances and even the type of treatment received.
Injection of an homogenate of identified neuron R15 into the hemocele of Aplysia produced a weight increase of 3-10% within 90 min. Control injections of several other identified neurons or of seawater, were ineffective. The weight increase occurred even when the animals were maintained in 5% hyperosmotic seawater. The activity of the R15 homogenate was retained after acidification to pH 2 and heating to 100 degrees C; but activity was destroyed by proteolytic digestion with Pronase. Dialysis in cellulose dialysis tubing resulted in a significant loss of aion on Sephadex G-50 (nominal exclusion limits 1,500-30,000 daltons), activity was present in the partially included volumes, but was absent in the totally excluded or totally included volumes. The data support the notion that R15 contains one or more hormones involved in ionic regulation or water balance. The results of bioassays of R15 extracts subjected to different treatments are consistent with the hypothesis that activity is due to one or more stable polypeptides of relatively low molecular weight.
Bovine erythrocyte superoxide dismutase was slowly and irreversibly inactivated by hydrogen peroxide. The rate of this inactivation was directly dependent upon the concentrations of both H2O2 and of enzyme, and its second-order rate constant at pH 10.0 and 25 degrees was 6.7 M-1 sec-1. Inactivation was preceded by a bleaching due to rapid reduction of Cu2+ on the enzyme, and following this there was a gradual reappearance of a new absorption in the visible region, which was coincident with the loss of catalytic activity. Inactivation of the enzyme was pH-dependent and indicated an essential ionization whose pKa was approximately 10.2. Replacement of H2O by D2O raised this pKa but did not diminish the catalytic activity of superoxide dismutase, measured at pH 10.0. Several compounds, including xanthine, urate, formate, and azide, protected the enzyme against inactivation by H2O2. Alcohols and benzoate, which scavenge hydroxyl radical, did not protect. Compounds with special affinity for singlet oxygen were similarly ineffective. The data were interpreted in terms of the reduction of the enzyme-bound Cu2+ to Cu+, by H2O2, followed by a Fenton's type reaction of the Cu+ with additional H2O2. This would generate Cu2+-OH- or its ionized equivalent, Cu2+-O--, which could then oxidatively attack an adjacent histidine and thus inactivate the enzyme. Compounds which protected the enzyme could have done so by reacting with the bound oxidant, in competition with the adjacent histidine.
The levels of the adenine nucleotides, pyridine nucleotides and the kinetical parameters of the enzymes of the Entner-Doudoroff pathway (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase) were determined in Azotobacter vinelandii cells, grown under O2- or N2-limiting conditions. It was concluced that the levels of both the adenine nucleotides and pyridine nucleotides do not limit the rate of sucrose oxidation. Experiments with radioactive pyruvate and sucrose show that the rate of sucrose oxidation of Azotobacter cells is associated with an increase in the rate of sucrose uptake. The sites of oxidative phosphorylation and the composition of the respiratory membranes with respect to cytochromes c4 + c5, b and d differ in cells growth either O2- or N2-limited. It was possible to show that the respiration protection of the nitrogen-fixing system in Azotobacter is mainly independent of the oxidation capacity of the cells. The oxidation capacity intrinsically depends on the type of substrate and can be partly adapted. The maximum activity of the nitrogenase in Azotobacter depends on the type of substrate oxidized. Although the level of energy charge is somewhat dependent on the type of substrate used, no obvious relation can be derived between changes in energy charge and nitrogenase activity. An alternative proposal is given.
Investigations on the mechanism of the IMP dehydrogenase (IMP: NAD+ oxidoreductase, EC 1.2.1.14) reactions have been made at pH 7.0 by measuring rates of isotope exchange at chemical equilibrium with K+ maintained at a constant concentration. The results are generally in accord with the conclusions reached on the basis of the steady-state kinetic data obtained previously and confirm that there is random addition of IMP and NAD to the enzyme. The data also indicate clearly that at pH 7.0 catalysis is faster than the rate of IMP and/or XMP release which is rate limiting for the reaction sequence. The binding of IMP to the enzyme at pH 8.1 has been demonstrated to occur in the absence of both K+ and NAD and id independent of the K+ concentration.
Transplantable mammary adenocarcinomas and livers of C3H mice fed a stock diet or a linoleate rich diet (15% corn oil) contain similar amounts of oleate (ca 3 mg/gm tissue). On feeding either a high carbohydrate, fat free or a high carbohydrate, saturated fat-containing (15% hydrogenated coconut or cottonseed oil) diet for 6 weeks, oleate levels increased 2-fold in tumor and 5-fold in liver. The specific activity of stearoyl-CoA desaturase in liver microsomes was similar to that in the corresponding fractions of mammary glands of lactating mice. In liver, this activity was enhanced 2- to 3-fold by feeding a high carbohydrate, fat free or a high carbohydrate, saturated fat diet. The desaturase activity in mammary tumor microsomes, while only 10% of that in hepatic microsomes, remained unaltered regardless of the type of diet fed. These observations suggest that (a) a major portion of the oleate in the mammary tumor is not produced within the tissue, (b) dietary adaptation is not a general characteristic of stearoyl-CoA desaturase in neoplastic tissues, and (c) enhanced desaturase activity in liver is directly related to the absence of linoleate or oleate, or to a large decrease in oleate in the diet.
Alkaline phosphatase [EC 3.1.3.1.] was purified about 250-fold from rat kidney, and its enzymological properties were studied. Kidney homogenate was extracted with n-butanol, passed through Sephadex G-200 and chromatographed on a DEAE-cellulose column. The peak from the DEAE-cellulose column was subjected to isoelectric focusing, and the alkaline phosphatase activity was separated into two peaks. The molecular weights of alkaline phosphatase in these peaks were 4.8.X10(4) and 1.0X10(5), as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Anti-serum against alkaline phosphatase from rat kidney was prepared, and was shown to neutralize the activity from kidney, liver or bone, but not that from intestine.
The component of crude phospholipid responsible for B. matruchotii calcification was isolated. Crude phospholipid, extracted from the microorganism, was separated into five fractions by column chromatography. A single, protein-containing fraction catalyzed apatite formation in a metastable calcium phosphate solution. The nucleating fraction was identified as a proteolipid.
A modified version of systematic desensitization was used to reduce the anxiety and negative interpersonal consequences produced by a recurrent aversive dream resulting from events in the real world. The subject, a 16-year-old incarcerated male, was first taught a standard relaxation technique. The subject's dream was divided into 12 hierarchical imaginal scenes. Following initial relaxation, each scene was sequentially introduced and followed by the therapist's suggestion that the subject was still very relaxed. After three sessions with the therapists and several practice sessions by himself, the subject reported no further anxiety to the dream (which continued to occur) and improved relations with the institutional staff. Six months of follow-up showed no recurrence of the anxiety or the subsequent irritability which the subject had initially reported as leading to negative interpersonal relations with the staff.
Using a rapid pH electrode, measurements were made of the flash-induced proton transport in isolated spinach chloroplasts. To calibrate the system, we assumed that in the presence of ferricyanide and in steady-state flashing light, each flash liberates from water one proton per reaction chain. We concluded that with both ferricyanide and methylviologen as acceptors two protons per electron are translocated by the electron transport chain connecting Photosystem II and I. With methyl viologen but not with ferricyanide as an acceptor, two additional protons per electron are taken up due to Photosystem I activity. One of these latter protons is translocated to the inside of the thylakoid while the other is taken up in H2O2 formation. Assuming that the proton released during water splitting remains inside the thylakoid, we compute H+/e- ratios of 3 and 4 for ferricyanide and methylviologen, respectively. In continuous light of low intensity, we obtained the same H+/e- ratios. However, with higher intensities where electron transport becomes rate limited by the internal pH, the H+/e- ratio approached 2 as a limit for both acceptors. A working model is presented which includes two sites of proton translocation, one between the photoacts, the other connected to Photosystem I, each of which translocates two protons per electron. Each site presents a approximately 30 ms diffusion barrier to proton passage which can be lowered by uncouplers to 6-10 ms.
Buffalo sperm acrosome resembles its counterpart in other species, being rich in hydrolytic enzymes. Of the enzyme activities estimated, acid phosphatase, beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase and hyaluronidase were low compared to those of ram semen. However, the aryl sulphatase activity was high. GOT activity estimated in sperm preparation may not be of acrosomal origin.
The surgical treatment of a severe injury in the cubital region of a bus-driver, aged 47, is reported. Because of the extended contamination and the splintered fracture radical wound excision - involving also the chondral surfaces - has been performed and hereupon humero-radial arthrodesis was carried out. The skin defect has been successfully treated secondarily by insert of a flap. After uneventful recovery the patient could resume his work 6 months after the injury again.
The graft-versus-host (GVH) reactivity of uremic and control spleen cells was studied by popliteal lymph node assay in the rat. The reaction evoked by cells from animals with severe uremia was conspicuously weaker than that evoked by control cells. The magnitude of the GVH reaction induced by control cells was directly proportional to dose, while with the uremic cells the same increases in dose led only to insignificant increases in the strength of the GVH reaction. When mixtures of syngeneic control and uremic cells were used, the GVH reactivity of the control cells was suppressed. The activity of uremic spleen cells can be enhanced (restored) by removal of the sub-population of cells adherent to glass wool. The GVH reaction induced by uremic cells so treated became directly proportional to dose. The removal of the adherent cell population from the uremic spleen cell suspension also led to the disappearance of the suppressor effect in mixtures of control and uremic cells. These results indicate that a decrease in GVH activity of rat uremic spleen cells is due to an increase in suppressor cell activity in the uremic spleen cell population.
As shown previously, proteinases frequently associated with plasma albumin samples catalyze a very limited and specific cleavage of the albumin molecule when it exists in the F conformational state near pH 3.7. The primary proteolytic product, BPA, has a molecular weight similar to or identical with that of the parent protein but yields two large fragments of molecular weight approximately 46000 and 23000 on reduction. Evidence is presented here that cleavage occurs within the disulfide loop between Cys390 and Cys434 with no detectable loss of small peptides, the amino acid composition of BPA being identical with that of the parent protein within experimental error. Cleavage exposes a new amino-terminal phenylalanine residue and may occur at the Glx392-Phe393 bond although the possibility exists that it occurs at another X-Phe bond in the unsequenced region of residues 400-402. The damaged protein has a somewhat altered secondary structure as judged from optical rotatory dispersion and circular dichroism measurements, probably an approximate 15% loss in helicity. The hydrodynamic volume is increased by approximately 20%. However, various physical studies indicate the tertiary structure to be strikingly similar to that of the native protein. Of most significance is the fact that the protein still undergoes the N-F and N-B transitions, although in both cases they occur at somewhat more moderate pH than in the parent protein. Moreover a sensitivity of the N-B transition to Ca2+ is still seen and binding behavior toward the dye 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid is essentially unaltered. The results are best understood in terms of the concept of a multidomain structure which has been suggested frequently for plasma ablumin. Bond cleavage damages one domain but leaves the overall structure essentially unaltered except for some weakening of the interaction between domains.
Solutions of pure cannabinoids, nine samples of herbal and two of resin cannabis (one freshly prepared) were stored in varying conditions for up to 2 years. Exposure to light (not direct sunlight) was shown to be the greatest single factos in loss of cannabinoids especially in solutions, which should therefore be protected from light during analytical and phytochemical operations. Previous claims that solutions in ethanol were stable have not been substantiated. The effect of temperature, up to 20 degrees, was insignificant but air oxidation did lead to significant losses. These could be reduced if care was taken to minimize damage to the glands which act as "well filled, well closed containers". Loss of tetrahydrocannabinol after exposure to light does not lead to an increase in cannabinol, but air oxidation in the dark does. It is concluded that carefully prepared herbal or resin cannabis or extracts are reasonably stable for 1 to 2 years if stored in the dark at room temperature.
We have examined the bacteriochlorophyll reaction-center complex of Chlorobium limicola f. thiosulfatophilum, strain Tassajara. Our results indicate that the midpoint potential of the primary electron donor bacteriochlorophyll of the reaction center is +250 mV at pH 6.8, while that of cytochrome c-553 is +165 mV. There are two cytochrome c-553 hemes per reaction center, and the light-induced oxidation of each is biphasic (t1/2 of less than 5 mus and approximately 50 mus). We belive that this indicates a two state equilibrium with each cytochrome heme being either close to, or a little removed from, the reaction-center bacteriochlorophyll. We have also titrated the primary electron acceptor of the reaction center. Its equilibrium midpoint potential at pH 6.8 is below -450 mV. This is very much lower than the previous estimate for green bacteria, and also substantially lower than values obtained for purple bacteria. Such a low-potential primary acceptor would be thermodynamically capable of direct reduction of NAD+ via ferredoxin in a manner analagous to photosystem I in chloroplasts and blue-green algae.
The effects of local injections of drugs into terminal areas of the mesolimbic dopamine system were investigated. Bilateral administration of dopamine, but not of noradrenaline and serotonin, into the nucleus accumbens of non-pretreated rats resulted in stimulation of locomotor activity. No clear or only minor effects were seen after injections of the dopamine metabolites 3-methoxytyramine, DOPAC and HVA and after injections of media with different pH and osmolality. d-Amphetamine proved more effective than dopamine in producing locomotor stimulation, whereas both stimulant and depressant effects were observed following injection of apomorphine into the nucleus accumbens. ET 495 and the noradrenaline agonists clonidine, phenylephrine and isoprenaline did not enhance locomotor activity, but theophylline was effective. Pretreatment with haloperidol, but not with clozapine, significantly reduced the effects of dopamine and theophylline. Locomotor stimulation was also found following bilateral administration of dopamine, d-amphetamine and apomorphine into the tuberculum olfactorium, whereas noradrenaline, serotonin and ET 495 produced no, or rather depressant effects. These results provide further evidence for an important role of the mesolimbic dopamine system with respect to locomotor activity.
Mouse and rat brain cells were dissociated by a simple mechanical sieving technique and studied in culture for the formation of aggregates and the activities of choline acetyltransferase, acetylcholinesterase, glutamic acid decarboxylase, tyrosine 3-monooxygenase, aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase, catechol methyltransferase, and monoamine oxidase. Cells from fetal and neonatal tissue formed aggregates but not cells from tissue older than two days after birth. The pattern of development of enzyme activities in these aggregates varied with the age of starting tissue. The highest levels of specific activity for the neuron-specific enzymes were found after 3-4 weeks in culture for aggregates of cells derived from relatively undeveloped brains.
From own experiences the observations of 3 patients were reported who were immunosuppressively treated with purine antagonists (azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine). Hereby in a severe allergic vasculitis in a 22-year-old patient and in a granulomatous arteritis during Wegener's granulomatosis in a 51-year-old patient remissions for more than 1 and 7 years, respectively, could be achieved under immunosuppressive long-term therapy. In the case of a periarteriitis nodosa death took place 2 months after administration of 6-mercaptopurine.
The binding of Ca2+ to monolayers and bilayers of phosphatidylserine has been investigated as a function of pH, ionic strength (NaCl concentration) and Ca2+ concentration using surface and colloid chemical techniques. The molar ratio of lipid to bound calcium decreases to 2 as the Ca2+ concentration is increased to about 0.1 mM. At [Ca2+] greater than 0.1 mM a 1:1 complex is formed. The apparent binding constant Ka ranges from about approximately 10(6) - 10(4) l/mol depending on the Ca2+ concentration. After allowing for electrostatic effects and neighbour group interactions, the intrinsic binding constant Ki of the phosphorylserine polar group at pH 7 (I = 0.01 M), where it carries a net negative charge of one, is approximately 10(4) l/mol; consistent values for Ki were obtained using several independent approaches. Ka for Ca2+ binding decreases with increasing NaCl concentration because the monovalent cations compete with Ca2+ for the same binding site. Na+ and K+ are equally effective in displacing 45Ca2+ adsorbed to monolayers of phosphatidylserine, both with respect to the kinetics and the equilibrium of the displacement. Ka for the reaction between phosphatidylserine and monovalent cations is about 10(3)-fold smaller than that of Ca2+. An investigation of the binding of Mn2+ to phosphatidylserine by both surface chemical and nuclear magnetic resonance methods shows that this cation has a similar binding constant to that of Ca2+. The Ca2+-binding capabilities of monolayers containing only carboxyl groups (i.e. arachidic acid) and phosphodiester groups (i.e. dicetyl phosphate) have also been determined; the apparent pK for the - COOH group in monolayers is larger than or equal to 9 and that for the phosphodiester group is less than 4. Since these groups do not retain the same pK values when they are in close proximity in the phosphorylserine group, the relative contributions of the two groups to the binding of Ca2+ to phosphatidylserine is not obvious.
The levels of six lysosomal enzymes (acid phosphatase, beta-acetylglucosaminidase, cathepsin D, beta-galactosidase, arylsulfatase A, and beta-glucuronidase) and four neutral and alkaline hydrolases (esterase, inorganic phyrophosphatase, alkaline phosphatase, and 5'-nucleotidase) were measured in osteoarthritic, rheumatoid and control synovia. All enzyme levels in diseased synovium except esterase values in osteoarthritis were significantly elevated compared with controls. The mean values of the group of acid hydrolases and the group of neutral and alkaline hydrolases in osteoarthritic synovia were 1.9- and 2.0-fold greater than those of control specimens. In rheumatoid synovia, the values were 4.2- and 4.5 fold greater than control for the same enzymes. Levels in rheumatoid synovia were significantly higher than those in osteoarthritic synovia with the exception of 5'-nucleotidase. Only a limited correlation between the extents of inflammation present in the synovia and the levels of a lysosomal marker enzyme (cathepsin D) was observed. These results demonstrate that whatever the mechanism, increased levels of acid hydrolases as well as certain neutral and alkaline hydrolases are present in osteoarthritic and rheumatoid synovia, and these enzymes are probably contained in the synovial lining cells.
Residues 4 and 5 of the pentapeptide moiety, R-Ala1-DGlu2-Lys3-DAla4-DAla5, of peptidoglycan play an important role in the donor phase of cross-linked glycan synthesis. To assess the role of these residues in this phase, a series of UDP-MurNAc-peptides were biosynthesized with residues 4 and 5 replaced singly by either D-alpha-amino-n-butyric acid, D-norvaline, or D-valine. The six nucleotides were compared with UDP-MurNAc-Ala-DGlu-Lys-DAla-DAla (reference) in nascent (penicillin-insensitive) peptidoglycan synthesis and in penicillin-sensitive peptidoglycan synthesis. The synthesis of penicillin-sensitive peptidoglycan is catalyzed by membrane-walls isolated from Gaffkya homari and would appear to require the concerted action of transglycosylase and transpeptidase. The membrane-wall system shows a high degree of discrimination for the steric substituents, -CH3 and -CH2CH3, in residue 4. For example, for UDP-MurNAc-Ala-DGly-Lys-DAbu-DAla and -Ala-DGlu-Lys-DAla-DAbu, Vmax/km is 0.19 and 0.95 and Vmax is 0.03 and 0.52, respectively, of the value for the reference nucleotide. In contrast, for the synthesis of nascent peptidoglycan with these nucleotides Vmax/Km is 0.75 and 0.80, and Vmax is 0.71 and 1.0, respectively, of the value for the reference nucleotide. This trend was also illustrated with the other nucleotides in the time course experiments. These results indicate that the penicillin-sensitive enzyme(s), presumably the transpeptidase, has a higher degree of specificity in the donor phase for D-alanine in residue 4 than for D-alanine in residue 5 in the cross-linking stage of peptidoglycan synthesis.
The treatment of spinach chloroplasts with p-nitrothiophenol in the light at acidic and neutral pH'S caused specific inhibition of the Photosystem II activity, whereas the same treatment in the dark did not affect the activity at all. The photosystem I activity was not inhibited by p-nitrothiophenol both in the light and in the dark. The inhibition was accompanied by changes of fluorescence from chloroplasts. As observed at room temperature, the 685-nm band was lowered by the p-nitrothiophenol treatment in the light and, at liquid nitrogen temperature, the relative height of the 695-nm band to the 685-nm band increased and the 695-nm band shifted to longer wavelengths. The action spectra for these effects of p-nitrothiophenol on the activity and fluorescence showed a peak at 670 nm with a red drop at longer wavelengths. It was concluded that the light absorbed by Photosystem II is responsible for the chemical modification of chloroplasts with p-nitrothiopehnol to causing the specific inhibition of Photosystem II.
The effects of a metabolic and respiratory acidosis and alkalosis on intracellular pH (pHi) and K+ have been compared in cardiac and skeletal muscle from the anesthetized rabbit. The extracellular space and pHi were calculated from the distribution volumes of [51Cr] EDTA and [14C]DMO, respectively. When pHe was varied by altering PCO2, the slope of the line relating pHi to the extracellular pH (pHe) was greater (P less than 0.05--0.001) than that obtained during metabolic changes of pHe in right and left ventricles, atria, diaphragm, and quadriceps. During metabolic acidosis and alkalosis, the slope of pHi/pHe line did not vary between tissues. During respiratory acidosis, there was no difference in slope between cardiac tissues, but it was less in left ventricle than quadriceps (P less than 0.001). In left ventricle intracellular K+ increased in a metabolic (P less than 0.05) or respiratory acidosis (P less than 0.02), whereas in diaphragm it decreased (P less than 0.02). Intracellular K+ correlated with pHe and pHE-PHi. Changes in pHi but not intracellular K+ could explain known differences in myocardial function in respiratory and metabolic acidosis.
Methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase from C. thermoaceticum and C. formicoaceticum have been purified to homogeneity and compared. The two enzymes are very similar physically, chemically, and kinetically, but he C. thermoaceticum enzyme has a higher thermostablility, which is an intrinsic property of the protein. Formate dehydrogenase enzymes from both bacteria require selenite and tungstate for formation and these enzymes also appear to have similar properties, although the C. thermoaceticum is stable at 70 degrees C for more than one hour. Acetate kinase from C. thermoaceticum appears to be under metabolic  control. It can be concluded that enzymes from C. thermoaceticum, although they are more thermostable, are very similar to corresponding enzymes from mesophilic organisms.
1. Unlike chloroplasts, submitochondrial particles are not uncoupled by nigericin + KCl or NH4Cl. Also the uncoupling effect of lipophilic anions is largely independent of the addition of weak bases. 2. Low concentrations of permeant anions cause a shift of the steady-state energy level rather than a cycle of energy utilization. The degree of inhibition of ATP synthesis by tetraphenylboron is larger than required for the uptake of the anion. 3. Lipophilic anions such as bromthymolblue, bromcresolpurple, and 8-anilino-1-napthalene sulphonate cause a pH-independent, 50% uncoupling in submitochondrial particles at concentrations of 3, 30 and 30 muM, respectively. The passive interaction of bromthymolblue and bromcresolpurple appears as a pH-dependent distribution between two pHases. ATP causes a pH-independent slight shift in the anion distribution, with negligible anion accumulation. 4. Addition of amines to energized submitochondrial particles results in two types of effects; uptake of amines and uncoupling. While in chloroplasts amine uptake and uncoupling are closely associated, this is not the case in submitochondrial particles. The uncoupling effect is observed only with lipophilic and not with hydrophilic amines, and the degree of uncoupling increases with the lipophilicity of the amines. The amine uptake, on the other hand, is accompanied by negligible uncoupling. 5. While the uptake of amines is dependent on the presence of non-permeant anions, such as Cl-, the uncoupling effect is independent of Cl-. Furthermore the amine uncoupling is markedly enhanced by lipophilic anions. 6. The view is discussed that the uncoupling effect of lipophilic anions and lipophilic amines in submitochondrial particles is due to a catalytic energy dissipation rather than to a stoichiometry energy utilization. The molecular mechanism of uncoupling presumably involves a cycling of charges after a perturbation of the membrane structure.
When investigating activity of glutamine synthetase of the enzymatic preparations isolated from the brain of rats of 0.5, 1, 3, 12 and 24-month age, no considerable differences were found in the indices of the values Km to a-glutamate and Vmax which are respectively equal to: Km (M-10(-3))=5.5; 3.5; 3.6; 3.9; 5.5; Vmax=3.1; 4.5; 5.0; 5.2 muM were found. When adding various concentrations of a-ketoglutaric acid into the incubation medium the differences are registered in the degree and character of the age changes in brain glutamine synthetase activity in comparison with this enzyme form the liver.
Mice were given a drug per os and 2 h later were challenged with an intravenous LD95 of nicotine. Amitriptyline, imipramine, doxepin, meprobamate, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, trifluoroperazine, haloperidol, thioridazine, chlorpromazine, phenobarbital, propranolol and diphenylhydantoin were all active in protecting mice from extensor convulsions and lethality. Iproniazid, tranylcypromine, atropine, benztropine and trimethadione were inactive. There appears to be a relationship between blockage of nicotine-induced extensor convulsions and lethality in mice and sedative-antianxiety effects in man. This relationship is especially good for drugs designated antidepressant, antianxiety and antipsychotic.
In young males with essential hypertension, propranolol and pindolol in small doses caused significant expansion of plasma volume (PV) after one month which did not prevent a reduction in BP. With higher doses, changes in PV were inconsistent and reductions in plasma renin activity (PRA) and 24-hour aldosterone excretion (AE) not closely related to BP changes. The effects of beta-adrenoreceptor blocking drugs on PV, PRA, and AE do not appear to be important components of their anti-hypertensive action.
Acute aneurysms and other morphologically defined cardiac lesions were produced in frogs by isoproterenol (IPR) as previously described. Samples from lesions verified in vivo and from macroscopically normal ventricular areas, together with samples from nontreated control animals, were analyzed for total water content, inulin space, pHe, and pHi by using DMO-14C and inulin-3H. Total cardiac tissue water content was increased in all types of lesions after IPR injection. The highest content was found in bulging, noncontractile aneurysms. Inulin space was enlarged in all heart muscle specimens from IPR-treated animals, including those without macroscopically visible lesions. Those specimens with aneurysms showed the greatest degree of enlargement. The (pHe-pHi) did not differ between injected and noninjected animals, and the noncontractile samples from aneurysms did not differ from other lesions and macroscopically intact areas. In IPR-injected animals, there was no difference in pHi between macroscopically damaged and nondamaged segments of ventricle wall. On comparing these animals to controls, however, a slight shift to the alkaline side for both pHi and pHe was observed. The (pHe-pHi) was higher in skeletal muscle than in heart muscle in both IPR-treated and nontreated animals. Tissue water increased in skeletal muscle after IPR injection, reflecting a change of intracellular water as inulin space was maintained.
This study investigates the effect of flunitrazepam, a new benzodiazepine, on the sleep of insomniac patients under chronic treatment. Polygraphic recordings have shown that this drug decreases not only the activity of the wakefulness system, but also the activity of the synchronizing system of slow-wave sleep. The subjective feeling of improved and sounder sleep seems to be related to a decrease of wakefulness pressure as well as to a decrease of body motoricity, but not with the modification of sleep stages themselves. Flunitrazepam appears to possess some regulatory properties on REM sleep, since this stage is enhanced in patients with an initial low amount of REM sleep and decreased in those having a higher initial REM sleep. Flunitrazepam possesses potent and useful hypnogenic properties in man but does not induce physiological sleep.
The effect of Visken was analysed in children with primary arterial hypertension, Stage IB, with reference to their general state, dynamics of cardiac contractions, arterial pressure, cardiac output, and vascular peripheral resistance. The treatment was undertaken in 28 children lasting from 6 to 8 weeks. A multiformity of the drug's effect upon the state of the children with early hypertension was noted. The response of different parameters of the circulatory system to Visken is individual. Side effects may develop against the background of even low doses.
The citrate synthase activity of Acetobacter xylinum cells grown on glucose was the same as of cells grown on intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The activity of citrate synthase in extracts is compatible with the overall rate of acetate oxidation in vivo. The enzyme was purified 47-fold from sonic extracts and its molecular weight was determined to be 280000 by gel filtration. It has an optimum activity at pH 8.4. Reaction rates with the purified enzyme were hyperbolic functions of both acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate. The Km for acetyl-CoA is 18 mum and that for oxaloacetate 8.7 mum. The enzyme is inhibited by ATP according to classical kinetic patterns. This inhibition is competitive with respect to acetyl-CoA (Ki = 0.9 mM) and non-competitive with respect to oxaloacetate. It is not affected by changes in pH and ionic strength and is not relieved by an excess of Mg2+ ions. Unlike other Gram-negative bacteria, the A. xylinum enzyme is not inhibited by NADH, but is inhibited by high concentrations of NADPH. The activity of the enzyme varies with energy charge in a manner consistent with its role in energy metabolism. It is suggested that the flux through the tricarboxylic acid cycle in A. xylinum is regulated by modulation of citrate synthase activity in response to the energy state of the cells.
The rapid and sensitive assay of 1beta,2beta-3H-androgen aromatization by measurement of 3H2O release (Thompson, E.A., Jr., and Siiteri, P.K. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 5364-5372) has been analyzed to determine its applicability to initial rate studies. It was found that aromatization is the sole reaction catalyzed by lyophilized placental microsomes that causes a loss of tritium from position 1 or 2 of androstenedione and testosterone. Tritium is, however, removed from position 2 of the estrogen products, presumably in 2-hydroxylation, but this does not invalidate use of the assay for initial rate measurements; it was therefore used to characterize the catalytic properties of aromatase. Aromatization by the freeze-dried preparation was stimulated by K+, EDTA, and dithiothreitol, and was maximally active at pH 7.5 TO 8.0. With incubation conditions optimized for these factors, the apparent Km for NADPH is approximately 1 muM. The maximum velocity of androstenedione aromatization exceeds that of testosterone, and the affinity of the substrate binding site is higher for the former substrate, the apparent Km values being 0.1 muM and 0.4 muM, respectively. Mutual competition experiments with the androgen substrates showed that each gives simple competitive inhibition of the other's aromatization; furthermore, the apparent Ki values for each are in close agreement with their respective Km values. Androst-1,4,6-triene-3,17-dione competitively inhibits the aromatization of both androstenedione and testosterone, the apparent Ki, in both cases being 0.2 muM. It is concluded that the two androgen substrates are aromatized at a single, identical site.
Six apparently healthy young males (20 +/- 0.5 years of age) lived in a specially designed laboratory for a 1-week span in normal air, followed by 4 weeks in a 2% CO2 atmosphere and thereafter 1 week again in normal air. Room temperature was 24 degrees C. +/- 1 degrees C.; relative hygrometry 75% +/- 5%. With respect to socio-ecologic time clues and cues, the subjects were not isolated. The subjects' social synchronization was altered only by the shift-work schedule (light-on, 07(00); light-off, 22(30) on normal days). Every other day each subject had a 3-h night task, located between 23(00) and 07(00). Once a week, during 48 hrs (Saturday and Sunday) a set of physiologic variables was documented every 4 hrs in order to study their circadian changes: oral temperature, peak expiratory flow, grip strength, arterial blood pressure, tempo, and urinary pH, volume and potassium excretion. As far as rhythms are detectable (cosinor method) the most striking result is that both rhythm acrophases and amplitudes do not show any statistically significant changes when comparing either night-work versus day-work and/or normal air versus air with 2% CO2. Both 3 hrs of night-work every other day and an unusual amount of CO2 do not alter the parameters characterizing the circadian rhythms considered. The absence of desynchronization during night-work could be related to: 1) the speed of rotation in the shift-work; 2) the short duration of night-work; and 3) the youth of the subjects.
The electrolyte changes and renal hemodynamic adjustment to hypertonic sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) correction of a metabolic acidosis were studied in 4 neonatal lambs and in 2 controls. PAH clearance increased from 0.92 to 1.65 ml/min/kg (p less than 0.05),  urine flow from 0.37 to 0.61 ml/min/kg (p less than 0.05), and Na excretion from 8.4 to 23.7 muEq/min/kg (p less than 0.05) during the NaHCO3 infusion. These increases were transient and returned to pre-infusion levels following NaHCO3 infusion. Calculation of Na intake and output revealed a net retention of 5.1 mEq/kg in the study lambs which was reflected in a rise of serum Na and osmolarity (Osm) during the post-NaHCO3 -infusion period. The extraction ratio of sodium p-aminohippurate (EPAH) and its relationship to arterial pH were studied in 4 additional lambs. The EPAH did not change with metabolic acidosis but for unknown reasons, the infusion of NaHCO3 resulted in a temporary depression of EPAH (p less than 0.001).
Solubilities of deoxygenated sickle cell hemoglobin (deoxy-Hb S), at varying pH and temperature over a range of concentrations encompassing those found in erythrocytes, were measured. The technique involved ultracentrifugation, which gave values of the supernatant concentration and the mass of the sedimented material. The data establish that the solubility of doexy-Hb S is the saturation concentration and is independent of initial concentration. The mass of the pellet phase increases linearly with initial concentration. Moreover, the saturation concentration represents the critical concentration above which monomers are in equilibrium with polymers. These polymers are the putative cause of erythrocytes deformation associated with sickle cell anemia. The solubility-pH profiles of deoxy-Hb S at various temperatures, unlike those of other proteins, show no minima at the isoelectric pH but instead show a marked decrease in solubility below pH 7.0, indicating the predominance of polymerization over the expected increase in solubility. Deoxy-Hb S, within specified ranges of temperature and pH, possesses a negative temperature coefficient of solubility, a property characteristic of hydrophobic interactions. The saturation concentration is, however, temperature independent at conditions close to physiological. The enthalpy of polymerization (3.5 kcal/mol) is temperature independent from 6 degrees to 22 degrees for all pH values between 6.45 and 7.40. In the range of 22 degrees to 38 degrees, this parameter becomes less endothermic, having a value of 2.5 kcal/mol at pH 6.45 and a value of zero at pH 7.20. Such behavior of the system suggests a phase transition near 22 degreas. Within the range of conditions examined the polymerization is entropically driven.
Does intrauterine acidosis induce increased steroid secretion? The concentration of free steroids (CS) increases in both fetal and maternal plasma during labor and delivery. Fetal levels are higher after vaginal than after cesarean section. These differences may indicate an important role of the fetal adrenal gland in the induction of labor or they may reflect merely the fetal response to the stress of delivery. During incrased intrauterine stress steroid secretion is increased as shown here. We examined 41 mothers and their infants during pathological labor. Pathology was assessed from fetal acidosis and/or a clinically obstetric disease of the mother or fetus. The 41 cases included 9 cesarean sections, 8 forceps deliveries; 24 spontaneous deliveries of which 7 were premature. At the time of delivery the pH and CS level were determined in maternal and umbilical vessels in all cases. During spontaneous labor blood samples were also taken during the different stages of labour. A competetive protein binding assay with transcortin without fractionation of the steroids was used. Progesteron was determined by the same assay. The level of this hormone, however, remains unchanged and hence any changes reflect changes in CS. The levels of CS were correlated with the pH values and compared to previously obtained normal values. During pathological deliveries CS levels in both mother and fetus are normal as long as there is no acidosis (Fig. 1). If acidosis is present the CS level in the umbilical artery is usually higher than normal. In 13 out of 18 vaginal deliveries the CS level was above normal, in the other 5 at the upper limit of normal (Fig. 1 and 2). At the same time the a--v difference becomes smaller and sometimes even negative. No changes were noted in maternal and umbilical venous blood (Tab. I and II). Similar dependence on the pH was found for cesarean sections (Tab. III). In premature deliveries without acidosis in the umbilical artery the CS levels were lower in both mother and fetus (Tab. I). These results indicate that the fetal adrenal gland reacts to acidosis, i.e., intrauterine stress, with increased corticosteroid secretion. This rise depends on the pH of fetal blood and not on the type of delivery (Fig. 3).
A system for measuring the rate of transport of dehydroascorbate into human red blood cells shows Michaelis-Menten type kinetics with substrate inhibition at levels above 150 muM DHA. The addition of sugars impairs this transport in the diminishing hierarchy D-glucose, D-mannose, D-xylose, D-galactose, L-lyxose, D-araboascorbate, L-sorbose and 2-deoxy-D-ribose. The effect of glucose on transport of ascorbate is marked at physiological levels. Transport of DHA is accelerated by copper ion and allows dehydroascorbate to move against a concentration gradient. The evidence supports the hypotheses proposing that hyperglycemia will impair the intracellular availability of vitamin C.
A toxic substance, which destroyed leucocytes from man but was inactive against erythrocytes, was demonstrated in cultures of four out of 110 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa tested. The toxin, designated 'leucocidin', was cell-bound as a precursor toxin, exhibiting little or no toxicity. It was converted into toxin with maximum activity by various proteases including an endogenous elastase. The production of leucocidin was directly proportional to the number of bacteria and was not influenced by variations in media, iron concentration, pH or temperature. The best method for large-scale production of leucocidin was autolysis of washed bacteria.
A new apparatus, which combines an electron microprobe and a scanning electron microscope, has been used. This apparatus enabled to conduct a systematic elemental analysis of two species among Aspergillaceae. All elements in the periodic table whose atomic numbers lie between boron and uranium can be detected.
Mice primed with a thymus- (T) dependent form of Type III pneumococcal polysaccharide (S3), i.e., S3 coupled to erythrocytes (S3-RBC) produce S3-specific IgG antibody after secondary challenge with either S3 or S3-RBC. The production of IgG antibody by mice challenged with S3 was shown to be T independent since secondary responses were enhanced when mice were treated with anti-lymphocyte serum (ALS) at the time of secondary challenge with S3 and T-depleted spleen cells responded as well as unfractionated spleen cells to S3 in an adoptive transfer system. Secondary S3-specific IgG responses in mice challenged with S3-RBC were shown to be T dependent by the same criteria. The results obtained by using S3 as the antigen indicate that IgG-producing B cells (B lambda cells) can recognize and respond to antigen in the absence of helper T cells. On the other hand, T cells were required for the induction of S3-specific memory B lambda cells since mice depleted of T cells by treatment with ALS at the time of priming with S3-RBC failed to produce S3-specific IgG antibody after secondary challenge with either S3-specific IgG antibody after secondary chall-nge with either S3 or S3rbc. Since RBC-specific memory cells were induced in T-deprived mice the results suggest that T cell regulation of IgG antibody production may vary for different antigens.
Experiments set up on unanesthetized, curarized cats demonstrated that sodium oxybutyrate in doses of 75--200 mg/kg and nembutal in doses of 5--20 mg/kg prolong the duration of corticospinal posterior roots potentials (PRP). The initial effect of morphine and promedol in doses of 1--3 and 0.5--1 mg/kg, respectively was not only a longer duration (by 30--40 msec), but also a higher amplitude of the PRP, evoked by the stimulation of the sensomotor cortex. Phentanyl used in a dose range of 0.01 to 0.06 mg/kg did not produce any changes in the descending PRP. Anesthetics (sodium oxybutyrate, nembutal, ether) and analgesics (morphine, phenadon) inhibited the corticospinal PRP, when used in large doses.
Ribeiroir marini cercariage emerge from the snail-host during the night, according to a circadian rhythm. The photoperiod is the synchronizer of this rhythm. Inversion of the photoperiod is immediately followed by inversion of the periodicity of emergence. No cercaria emerge in continuous light conditions. This inhibitory effect of light exerts its influence on the emergence but not on the production of cercariae. The rhythmic emergence is almost maintained in continous dark, but darkness cannot induce emergence at any time. It is possible that an innate production rhythm interferes with the emergence rhythm.
The oxidoreductase inhibitor is not formed from NADH as previously thought, but only from NAD under alkaline conditions. Analogues of NAD (e.g. NADP) and components of the NAD molecule (e.g. ADP) have no effect on the formation of the inhibitor. The most favourable pH, temperature, duration of incubation, type of buffer and NAD concentration for the formation of the inhibitor were investigated. The method for the formation and chromatographic isolation of the oxidoreductase inhibitor is briefly described.
A double-blind random study compared the effects of lorazepam and pantopon an intra-muscular premedication in healthy women for uterine curettage (D & C). Anxiety, as assessed by a self-rating test by the patient and by a trained observer, showed a significant reduction at one and one-half hours after lorazepam and a smaller reduction after pantopon, which was not significant. Sedation was satisfactory with no significant difference between the two drugs in the change before and after the premedication. Lorazepam showed much more amnesia than pantopon (p less than 0.001). The patients who had lorazepam required higher doses of thiopentone for the operation, and this, in part, led to longer intervals in recovery times after lorazepam. However, it is suggested that lorazepam itself was partly responsible for the longer recovery. Pantopon was followed by more nausea, vomiting and headaches, than lorazepam. The intra-muscular injection of lorazepam hurt more patients than did pantopon, but other local complications were negligible and comparable in both groups. The results of this study show that lorazepam produces better reduction of anxiety and much more amnesia than pantopon, with comparable sedation and much less nausea and vomiting. The only disadvantage of lorazepam is the lack of analgesia and, therefore, the need for more anaesthesia during the operation. The conclusion is that lorazepam is a very satisfactory premedication and warrants more use as such.
A clinicopathological study of 206 Indian children with nephrotic syndrome showed a primary renal cause in 195 (96%), of which 77% were boys. In 126 children (96 boys, 30 girls) onset of the disorder occurred before the age of 5 years. Renal biopsy showed minimal lesions in 150 patients (77%); in 85 of these biopsy was done 3 months to 16 years after onset of the nephrotic syndrome. Significant renal histological abnormalities in 45 cases were labelled as mesangiocapillary 8, mesangioproliferative 4, proliferative with extensive crescents 2, membranous 3, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis 9, focal global glomerulosclerosis 2, advanced nonspecific 8, and mild proliferative 9. Nephritic manifestations were mainly associated with significant renal lesions, which were more frequently encountered when the onset of disease was after the age of 5 years. Clearance of proteinuria with corticosteroid therapy was practically confined to patients with minimal or mild renal histological changes. Our findings suggest that the pattern of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome in Indian children is similar to that reported from Western countries.
Freeze-fracture electronmicroscopy has been used to examine the membrane ultrastructure of human red blood cells in the presence of inhibitors of chloride exchange. The extent of inhibition was correlated with a decrease of intramembrane particle density on the B-fracture face. Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and glycerol, which markedly and reversibly reduced the intramembrane particle density, were shown to drastically and reversibly inhibit chloride self-exchange. DMSO was shown to be a noncompetitive inhibitor of chloride flux.
Angus and Hereford sperm motility was evaluated by an objective spectrophotometric procedure and by a conventional subjective ranking system. Semen was collected by electroejaculation and divided so that one group contained 6 Angus samples and one group contained 12 Hereford samples. Objective procedures indicated that Angus sperm was twice motile as Hereford sperm in 2.9% sodium citrate. This objective procedure depends on the orientation of sperm in a flowing liquid and then spectrophotometrically measuring the sperm's ability to return to randomness when the flow is stopped. During preparation for freezing with liquid nitrogen, microscopic subjective ranking of sperm motility was carried out. Three conditions were studied subjectively: (I) arrival at the laboratory, (II) pre-freeze, and (III) thawed samples. No significant differences in subjective evaluation of sperm motility was found between conditions or breeds. Preliminary results indicate that this objective procedure can distinguish between the sperm motility in 2.9% sodium citrate from two breeds of cattle. Use of this objective procedure for studies relating to fertilization and artificial insemination is evident and there is no theoretical reason why the procedure can not be used with other species.
To produce a 125I-labelled glucagon suitable for radioligand assays, we studied the influence of variations in the lactoperoxidase iodination method. Both the degree of iodine substitution and the formation of monoiodo- or diiodo-tyrosines were pH dependent. The substitution increased and the diiodo-/monoiodotyrosine ratio decreased when pH increased. These two factors affected the immunoreactivity of the iodoglucagon relatively independently of each other. It was found that iodination at pH 10.0 with an average of 0.3 gatom I/mol glucagon resulted in 125I-labelled glucagon with higher immunoreactivity and stability than that produced at the conventional pH 7.5 and 8.5.
We describe a technique for measuring the water content of stools by the Karl Fischer method. The analysis is based on removal of water into a mixture of methanol/chloroform (1/2), after dispersion of the stool by sonication in presence of solvent. An aliquot of the solution thus obtained is placed in themeasuring cell of a Karl Fischer apparatus and then analyzed in the classic way. We further describe the advantages of this method (odorless, precise, reproducible) in contrast to other current methods. In addition the same organic solution can also be used in determining the lipid content of stools.
Pretreatment of rats with dexamethasone (2.5 mumol/kg, a dose which blocks the release of ACTH from the pituitary gland) abolished the reserpine mediated increase in cAMP and the increase in the cAMP/cGMP ratio in the adrenal medulla. In contrast, the reserpine-mediated induction of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) remained unchanged. Hypophysectomy had a similar effect to dexamethasone treatment. Since changes in cAMP and changes in the cAMP/cGMP ratio are not indispensible prerequisities for the subsequent induction of TH, a causal relationship between the two phenomena seems to be excluded.
The effects of divalent salts and 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU) upon nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) reduction and P700 in isolated chloroplasts are described and compared with the influence of DCMU on oxygen evolution and P700 in intact cells. Most experiments were carried out with a steady-state relaxation spectrometer. A kinetic mechanism for the estimation of P700 fluxes is proposed and experimentally tested. Good agreement between theory and experiment was found. Concurrent measurements of P700 and NADP reduction revealed two antagonisms: addition of divalent cations caused an increase in the yield of NADP reduction and a decrease in the yield of P700. Conversely, in the presence of Mg2+ low concentrations of DCMU decreased the yield of NADP reduction and increased the yield of P700. Aging of the chloroplasts at 30 degrees C exerted a similar effect. With far-red actinic light, Mg2+ stimulated the yield of NADP reduction without affecting the flux. Also, in the absence of Mg2+, DCMU inhibited both reactions although P700 required a higher herbicide concentration for fractional inhibition than NADP reduction. In the presence of Mg2+, chloroplasts resembled intact algae in which a high rate of oxygen evolution was accompanied by little P700 turn-over. Titration with DCMU decreased the rate of photosynthesis and increased P700 flux. On the whole, the data suggest that P700 relaxing in 20 msec is not directly involved in linear electron transport.
Human diferric transferrin was partially labeled with 59Fe at low or neutral pH (chemically labeled) and by replacement of diferric iron previously donated to rabbit reticulocytes (biologically labeled). Reticulocyte 59Fe uptake experiments with chemically labeled preparations indicated that iron bound at near neutral pH was more readily incorporated by reticulocytes than iron bound at low pH. The pH-dependent iron dissociation studies of biologically labeled transferrin solutions indicated that Fe3+, bound at the site from which the metal was initially utilized by the cells, dissociated between pH 5.8 and 7.4. In contrast, lower pH (5.2--5.8) was required to effect dissociation of iron that has remained bound to the protein after incubation with reticulocytes. These findings suggest that each human transferrin iron-binding site has different acid-base iron-binding properties which could be related to the observed heterogenic rabbit reticulocyte iron-donating properties of human transferrin and identifies that the near neutral iron-binding site initially surrenders its iron to these cells.
Rats subjected to pinealectomy or to pinealectomy plus bilateral superior cervical ganglionectomy exhibited depressed serotonin uptake by hypothalamic synaptosomes; norepinephrine, dopamine or glutamate uptake was not affected by any of the surgical procedures. Treatment with melatonin resulted in inhibition of hypothalamic serotonin accumulation but it did not modify the uptake of norepinephrine, dopamine or glutamate. These data suggest a relationship between the pineal gland and the serotoninergic nerve endings of the hypothalamus.
The presence of paternal H-2 antigens on hybrid mouse blastocysts before and during implantation was investigated by means of the isotope anti-globulin technique. It was found that experimentally delayed blastocysts possess paternal H-2 antigens whereas these antigens can no longer be detected 14 hours after estradiol activation of delayed blastocysts.
The iron-sulfur proteins of the green photosynthetic bacterium Chlorobium have been characterized by oxidation-reduction potentiometry in conjunction with low-temperature electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Chlorobium ferredoxin was the only iron-sulfur protein detected in the soluble fraction; no high-potential iron-sulfur protein was observed. In addition, high-potential iron-sulfur protein was not detected in the chromatophores. Four chromatophore-bound iron-sulfur proteins were detected. One is the "Rieske" type iron-sulfur protein with a g-value of 1.90 in the reduced state; the protein has a midpoint potential of + 160 mV (pH 7.0), and this potential is pH dependent. Three g=1.94 chromatophore-bound iron-sulfur proteins were observed, with midpoint potentials of -25, -175, and about -550 mV. A possible role for the latter iron-sulfur protein in the primary photochemical reaction in Chlorobium is considered.
The kinetics of the photodynamic desactivation of lysozyme in presence of acridine orange as the sensitizer have been investigated in detail varying oxygen, protein, dye concentration, ionic strength and pH value. The kinetics can be approximately described as an over all pseudo-first-order rate process. Changing the solvent from water to D2O or by quenching experiments in presence of azide ions it could be shown that the desactivation of lysozyme is caused exclusively by singlet oxygen. The excited oxygen occurs via the triplet state of the dye with a rate constant considerably lower than that to be expected for a diffusionally controlled reaction. Singlet oxygen react chemically (desactivation, k=2.9 X 10(7) m(-1) sec(-1)) and physically (quenching process, k=4.1 X 10(8) m(-1) sec(-1)) with the enzyme. The kinetical analysis shows that additional chemical reaction between singlet oxygen and lysozyme would have only little influence on the kinetics of the desactivation as long as their products would be enzymatically active and their kinetical constants would be less than about 1 X 10(8) m(-1) sec(-1)).
An enzyme that oxidizes corticosteroids to acidic metabolites has been purified from postmortem human liver. The most rapidly oxidized substrate was 11-deoxycorticosterone (DOC). Other corticosteroids were oxidized at rates that were 10% or less of DOC. The products of DOC oxidation were 3, 20-dioxopregn-4-en-21-oic acid and 20-hydroxy-3-oxopregn-4-en-21-oic acid. The 20-keto acid was the predominant metabolite in all enzyme preparations. Keto acid and hydroxy acid were not interconverted. Enzyme activity was assayed by measuring the transfer of tritium from [21-3H]DOC to water. The enzyme is yellow, and has spectral maxima at 278 and 405 nm. Inhibition by o-phenanthroline suggests that it may be a metalloenzyme. Molecular weight was estimated at 74 000 +/- 8 000; a pH maximum occurred at pH 8-8.5. This enzyme may participate in the in vivo conversion of corticosteroids to the acidic metabolites that we have described previously (H.L. Bradlow et al. (1973), J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 37, 811).
An analysis of basic parameters representative of the acid-base balance was made in arterial blood samples from 140 clinically healthy dogs, under a general intravenous Thiopental anaesthesia. The following mean values +/- S.E.M. were obtained: pH = 7.33 +/- 0.01; pCO2 = 47.16 +/- 0.95; base excess = -2.12 +/- 0.27; buffer base = 46.63 +/- 0.37. The results showed a prevalent trend of lower values of pH, base excess and buffer base and higher values of pCO2 than those found commonly in human clinical practice. Special attention was paid to the respiratory component of the acid-base balance (ABB) revealing certain undesirable side effect of Thiopental anaesthesia.
Reserpine (1 mg/kg) was administered to pregnant rats on days 12, 13 and 14 of gestation. Although adrenal tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine beta-hydroxylase activities were normal in the offspring at 4 days of postnatal age, both were elevated by 17 days and the elevations persisted into adulthood. The changes may result from permanently increased sympatho-adrenal stimulation.
Infrared spectra of time- and size-classified atmospheric particulate samples collected with a inertial impactor reveal the presence of acid sulfate in the submicrometer-sized fraction. Although the degree of acidity is highly variable with time, the acidic nature of the particles is observed at all times of the day and may persist for several days in urban areas.
A new protease was isolated from an extract of leaves of Agave americana variegata. The protease (EC 3.4.-) was purified 565-fold with a yield of 39.5%. The 43.8 mg enzyme had a specific activity of 0.44 units/mg. According to electrophoretic, ultracentrifugal and other physical characterizations the enzyme was homogeneous. The enzyme had a MR of 57000, a S20,W-value of 4.37 S, a D20, W-value of 6.8-7.0 - 10(-7) cm2sec-1, a Stokes radius of 3.18 nm, a partial specific volume of 0.735 cm3g-1, a frictional ration of 1.25, a molecular absorbancy index at 280 nm of 5.773-10(4), an isoelectric point of 5.25 and contained 8-10% carbohydrate. The enzyme contained no cysteine. Agave protease could hydrolyze a variety of protein substrates although it did have a restricted specificity. It is not a sulphhydryl protease but seems to be an alkaline "serine" protease with an optimum pH of 7.8-8.0 Agave protease had marked esterolytic activity and with Cbz-Tyr-ONp had an apparent Michaelis constant of 0.0345 -10(-3) M and a V of 1.24 mol substrate/mol enzyme per sec. The enzyme did not need metal ions for optimal activity, monovalent cations did not influence its kinetic parameters, but it was inhibited by cobalt, pC1HgBzO- and TosPheCH2C1. With respect to its primary specificity, as well as its pH-dependence there was a resemblance with chymotrypsin, although the rate of hydrolysis of Agave protease is much lower.
Poly(8-aminoguanylic acid) has in neutral solution a novel ordered structure of high stability. The 8-amino group permits formation of three hydrogen bonds between two residues along the "top", or long axis, of the purines. The usual hydrogen bonding protons and Watson-Crick pairing sites are not involved in the association. The bonding scheme has a twofold rotation axis and is hemiprotonated at N(7). Poly(8NH2G) is converted by alkaline titration (pK = 9.7) to a quite different ordered structure, which is the favored form over the range approximately pH 10-11. The bonding scheme appears to be composed of a planar, tetrameric array of guanine residues, in which the 8-amino group does not participate in interbase hydrogen bonding. Poly (8NH2G) does not interact with poly(C) in neutral solution because of the high stability of the hemiprotonated G-G self-structure. Titration to the alkaline plateau, however, permits ready formation of a two-stranded Watson-Crick helix. In contrast to the monomer 8NH2GMP, poly(8NH2G) does not form a triple helix with poly(C) under any conditions. The properties of the ordered structures are interpreted in terms of a strong tendency of the 8-amino group to form a third interbase hydrogen bond, when this possibility is not prevented by high pH.
The electric properties of the bilayer lecithin membranes have been studied in the presence of the antibiotic nigericin. When the antibiotic concentration is about 10(-7) ohm-1 cm-2. The potassium ion concentration gradient gives rise to a transmembrane potential of the order of 40 mV per 10-fold concentration gradient with the side of the higher potassium concentration negative. The transmembrane potential produced by the hydrogen ion concentration gradient is a function of the potassium ion concentration which is equal on both sides of the membrane. For low potassium ion concentrations the hydrogen potential has the expected polarity with the solution having higher concentration of protons negative. For potassium ion concentrations exceeding 0.03 M the hydrogen potential has the reverse polarity. This unexpected result cannot be accounted for in terms of the available simple hypotheses about the charge transport mechanism for nigericin in BLM. In order to account for the experimental results obtained, a theoretical approach has been developed based on the assumption that charge is transported across the membrane by nigericin dimers. The theoretical predicitons are in satisfactory agreement with the experimental results. The model also yields some predictions which may be verified in future experiments.
pH of the sweat from patients with cystic fibrosis and in controls was measured as a function of the sweat-rate using a fluorescence-pH-indicator (umbelliferone). In both populations sweat is acid at low sweat-rates and alkaline at high ones. The results do not favour an abnormality of the ductal H+-secretion as the pathomechanism of cystic fibrosis.
A gas-liquid chromatographic method for the detection of perazine, thioridazine and its major metabolites in human plasma is presented. Repeated extraction, an internal standard and a temperature program with flame ionization detection make possible accurate and reproducible results with patients on therapeutic doses of these drugs. Examples of chromatograms after extraction of plasma are given.
The antibody response to type III pneumococcal polysaccharide (SS-II) was significantly increased in mice treated with antilymphocyte serum (ALS). BALG/c mice given 0.25 ml of ALS on days -1, 0, and 1 relative to the days of immunization with 0.5 mug of SSS-II had a 20-fold increment (11,383 increased to 199,917) in the number of splenic plaque-forming cells enumerated on day 5 compared with untreated, immunized controls. This effect has been attributed to the elimination of subpopulation of thymus-derived lymphocytes (T cells) that has suppressor function. The present series of experiments relate the augmented antibody response to SSS-II in mice treated with ALS to increased host resistance after infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae, type III (Pn-II). The 50%  lethal dose of Pn-III in niminnunized mice was 102 and the 100% lethal dose was 103 organisms. Mice immunized with 0.5 mug of SSS-III and challenged 5 days later with Pn-III were completely protected against a dose of up to 108 organisms. Mice treated with 0.25 ml of ALS on days -1, 0, and 1, immunized with SSS-III on day 0, and challenged with 2.5 X 10(9) Pn-III on day 5 had a mean survival time of greater than 100 h compared with 16 h for immunized non-serum-treated controls. Animals given a single injection of ALS before immunization showed no increase in resistance, whereas mice treated after immunization had significant prolongation of survival times. Untreated, immunized mice challenged with 5 X 10(9), 1 X 5 X 10(8) Pn-II survived 14 to 19 h, whereas ALS-treated animals had mean survival times of 48, 174, and 222 h, respectively. These findings suggest that immunoregulatory T cells may have a biologically significant effect in a narrow zone in which the normal host immune response is insufficient but still potentially capable of providing some additional degree of protection if suppressor cells are elimated.
Human glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase associated with NADPH was efficiently bound with agarose-bound NADP, whereas the enzyme associated with NADP was poorly bound with agarose-bound NADP. After the elimination of haemoglobin from haemolyzate by treatment with DEAE-cellulose, the enzyme was converted into the NADPH-bound form and was applied on an affinity column. The enzyme was specifically eluted from the column by NADP in the elution buffer. A homogeneous enzyme preparation was obtained in high yield.
Autolysis of Neisseria gonorrhoeae was studied under different conditions. It was found that low pH and temperature, as well as the presence of divalent cations, spermine, sucrose, and polyvinylpyrrolidone, stabilized nongrowing gonococci. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid alone promoted lysis, whereas lysozyme had only a limited additive effect. The autolytic behavior of gonococci appears to be connected with their prolonged cell division process. The relative dependence on the outer membrane and the peptidoglycan layer for the mechanical stability of gonococci is discussed.
The kinetics of rat liver L-type pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40), phosphorylated with cyclic AMP-stimulated protein kinase from the same source, and the unphosphorylated enzyme have been compared. The effects of pH and various concentrations of substrates, Mg2+, K+ and modifiers were studied. In the absence of fructose 1, 6-diphosphate at pH 7.3, the phosphorylated pyruvate kinase appeared to have a lower affinity for phosphoenolpyruvate (K0.5=0.8 mM) than the unphosphorylated enzyme (K0.5=0.3 mM). The enzyme activity vs. phosphoenolpyruvate concentration curve was more sigmoidal for the phosphorylated enzyme with a Hill coefficient of 2.6 compared to 1.6 for the unphosphorylated enzyme. Fructose 1, 6-diphosphate increased the apparent affinity of both enzyme forms for phosphoenolpyruvate. At saturating concentrations of this activator, the kinetics of both enzyme forms were transformed to approximately the same hyperbolic curve, with a Hill coefficient of 1.0 and K0.5 of about 0.04 mM for phosphoenolpyruvate. The apparent affinity of the enzyme for fructose 1, 6-diphosphate was high at 0.2 mM phosphoenolpyruvate with a K0.5=0.06 muM for the unphosphorylated pyruvate kinase and 0.13 muM for the phosphorylated enzyme. However, in the presence of 0.5 mM alanine plus 1.5 mM ATP, a higher fructose 1, 6-diphosphate concentration was needed for activation, with K0.5 of 0.4 muM for the unphosphorylated enzyme and of 1.4 muM for the phosphorylated enzyme. The results obtained strongly indicate that phosphorylation of pyruvate kinase may also inhibit the enzyme in vivo. Such an inhibition should be important during gluconeogenesis.
In the author's experience, the longterm treatment of chronic obstructive lung disease should be supplemented by continuous selective stimulation of the adrenergic beta-receptors in the smooth bronchial muscles. The following procedure is recommended: inhalation of 15 min 3 times daily using an adequate aerosol with a powered nebulizer (Pari-Privat), with 2-3 ml Tyloxapol carrier solution or saline with 5 drops salbutamol.
A radioimmunoassay procedure for guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (CGMP) is described. The procedure is based on competitive binding between [3H]CGMP and non-radioactive CGMP, with separation of bound and unbound CGMP by Millipore filtration. The binding reaction showed very high specificity to CGMP, had a broad pH optimum, and reached equilibrium within a short time. A simple procedure for the pruification of assay samples using Dowex AG 50W-X2 resin is also described. CGMP contents in urine samples were assayed without purification. Injection of glucagon into healthy human volunteers resulted in a small but significant reduction in urinary CGMP level, whereas CAMP excretion increased dramatically.
The reversible unfolding of alpha-lactalbumin by guanidine hydrochloride, was studied at 25.0 degrees C in a relatively low concentration range of the denaturant (0.80-2.00 mol/l) by means of difference spectra and pH-jump measurements. The unfolding was shown to occur between two states, N and D, because apparent rate-constants of the unfolding and the refolding reactions depended only on pH. All curves plotted as the logarithmical equilibrium constant log KD against pH could fall on the same base curve by shifting each curve along the log KD axis. From the dependence of the logarithmic rate constant on pH, master curves could also be made for the forward and the backward reactions. The dependence of these master curves on pH indicates that the groups affecting the pH dependence of the unfolding are three residues with pKN = 3.3 and pKA = pKD = 4.4, one residue with pKN = pKA = 3.8 and pKD = 4.4, and one residue with pKN = 5.8 and pKA = pKD = 6.3, where A indicates the activated state. On the other hand, from the denaturant activity dependence of the shift factors required for making the master curves, the value of the intrinsic binding constant of the denaturant to the protein was found to be similar to that obtained from previous measurements at pH 5.5. Differences between the numbers of the binding sites of the denaturant on the denaturated and the native proteins, and between those on the activated and the native proteins were shown to be 5.3 and 2.1, respectively. The free energy of stabilization in the native-like environment also shows that the protein in the native state is more unstable than lysozyme.
The chromatographic behaviour of 48 alkaloids has been studied on Bio-Rad AG 1-X4, Cellex D and microcrystalline cellulose, eluting with solutions of different pH but constant ionic strength (0.5). Many interesting separations were effected on both AG 1-X4 and Cellex D layers. The influence of pH on the chromatographic behaviour of alkaloids has been quantitatively studied and an equation was used that expresses the behaviour of the alkaloids on both AG 1-X4 (AcO-) and microcrystalling cellulose layers. The nonapplicability of this equation to Cellex D layers is discussed.
Non-occluded virions of a nuclear polyhedrosis virus of the alfalfa looper, Autographa californica, found in the medium of cell cultures of infected fall armyworm, Spodopter frugiperda, and in the hemolymph of infected S. frugiperda larvae were partially characterized by biological, chemical and physical methods. Also, the rate of appearance of the virions was studied in cell culture and the host insect to determine maximum virion production. Virions obtained from both sources were heat-sensitive, acid-labile and inactivated by several organic solvents. The non-occluded virions found in the insect cell culture fluid and in the hemolymph were identical, and both were enveloped nucleocapsids. Visualization of the fragilely enveloped nucleocapsid was accomplished only after fixation with glutaraldehyde. Differences between the non-occluded and occluded virions of nuclear polyhedrosis viruses are discussed.
Primary aldosteronism and renovascular hypertension are two different diseases in which renin determinations are necessary for establishment of diagnosis or therapeutic procedure. Low renin values which are not stimulated by acute stimuli combined with elevated plasma aldosterone concentrations confirm the diagnosis of primary aldosteronism. When in a patient with proven renal artery stenosis a significant difference in renal venous renin activity is observed between the two kidneys, a connection between hypertension and renal artery stenosis is likely when in addition the renin secretion of the unaffected kidney is suppressed. A favourable outcome for surgery can be predicted when the individual clinical picture in such a case is also considered. A similar view also holds for the connection between hypertension and unilateral small kidney not due to renal artery stenosis. In essential hypertension the plasma renin level makes it possible to a certain extent to predict whether a patient will benefit from diuretics or from beta-blocking agents. Despite this experience, however, renin determinations are not indicated in every case of essential hypertension. It has not been proven that the prognosis of this disease is improved by renin oriented monotherapy rather than by effective treatment with other antihypertensive agents.
Studies on neuronal control mechanisms of neurotransmitters biosynthesis during the development of peripheral and central autonomic synapses are reviewed. Particular emphasis is placed on investigations of developing peripheral sympathetic ganglia and brain in chick embryo and chick. Studies on the development of autonomic neurons and synapses under different pharmacological conditions are reported. Principally the effect of a) the administration of drugs and precursors such as L-dopa, 3H-dopa, 6-OH dopa; b) the prenatal administration of reserpine; c) the blockade of cholinergic receptors; d) the nerve growth factor (NGF) is analyzed. Results of developmental studies on chick ciliary ganglia are summarized. The review particulary underlines the importance of combining the use of sensitive microchemical methods to pharmacological tools in exploring the development of regulatory mechanisms at the cellular level.
Two cases of multiple gastric polyps associated with parathyroid adenomas are presented. A review of the literature revealed four patients with multiple gastric polyps and multiple endocrine adenomatosis. The possiblity of multiple gastric polyps as a variant of the MEA syndrome complex is explored. Emphasis is placed on the need for thorough endocrine evaluation in patients with multiple gastric polyps.
Pregnant women reported a decrease in the use of alcoholic beverages during pregnancy, often citing adverse physiological effects as a reason for the decline.
The enhancement of ergot alkaloid production by tryptophan and its analogues in both normal and high-phosphate cultures is more directly related to increased dimethylallyltryptophan (DMAT) synthetase activity rather than to a lack of regulation of the tryptophan biosynthetic enzymes. Thiotryptophan [beta-(1-benzo-thien-3-yl)-alanine] is rather ineffective in the end product regulation of tryptophan biosynthesis, whereas tryptophan and 5-methyltryptophan are potent effectors. The presence of increased levels of DMAT synthetase in ergot cultures supplemented with tryptophan or thiotryptophan, and to a lesser extent with 5-methyltryptophan, suggests that the induction effect involves de novo synthesis of the enzyme. Thiotryptophan and tryptophan but not 5-methyltryptophan can overcome the block of alkaloid synthesis by inorganic phosphate. The results with thiotryptophan indicate that the phosphate effect cannot be explained merely on the basis of a block of tryptophan synthesis.
Simple methods to enhance the detection of pneumococci in respiratory secretions are needed. Sheep blood agar containing 5 mug of gentamicin per ml was more often positive (89%) than either standard sheep blood agar (54%) or mouse inoculation (65%) in recovering pneumococci from 62 adult and pediatric patients. In adults, the direct quellung test on sputum smear was a rapid, sensitive method for predicting subsequent pneumococcal isolation by culture (19 of 20 patients, 95%). The quellung test and gentamicin plate show improved sensitivity over current techniques for pneumococcal detection and can be recommended for general use.
The formation of progesterone hydroxylases by Aspergillus niger 173 was investigated. The constitution of the fermentation medium influenced both the yield and the type of enzymes catalyzing the transformation of progesterone. The enzyme yield also varied with the pH value at which induction was performed as well as with the buffer used. The transformation activity of progesterone was more pronounced with mycelia induced in citrate-phosphate than in phosphate buffer. The results demonstrated that induction of 6beta-hydroxylase was favoured at pH values near neutrality while that of 11alpha-hydroxylase in the presence of citrate ions. The transformation activity of progesterone was optimal at pH 5.0. The action of 11alpha-hydroxylase was also optimal at pH 5.0, but other hydroxylase showed pH optima between 2.2 and 4.0. Progesterone concentrations higher than 6 mg in 50 ml reaction mixture was a limiting factor for the rate of transformation activity.
The clinical course of 40 patients with polyarteritis was reviewed to determine prognostic factors and response to treatment. The first three months were the most critical to survival. Survivorship was 57 per cent at five years. Older age of onset, involvement of skeletal muscle and presence of peripheral neuropathy weighted against a satisfactory outcome. Cutaneous vasculitis was associated with a more benign course. Myocardial disease, central nervous system involvement, or hypertension were not invariably poor prognostic factors. Muscle biopsies, even in the absence of clinical involvement, were a useful diagnostic procedure, and renal angiograms were found to be a valuable alternative to renal biopsy. An unequivocal distinction on clinical and histopathologic criteria could not be made among polyarteritis nodosa, hypersentitivity angiitis, and allergic granulomatosis. Australia antigenemia occurred in six per cent of patients. Although evaluation of therapy was difficult, data from this study did not show a superiority of high vs. low dosage of corticosteroids in suppressing active disease.
The effects of antihistamines, steroids and disodium cromoglycate on an immediate hypersensitivity reaction in the guinea pig eye are described in terms of clinical observations, histological examinations of sections of eyes and cytological studies of material from the conjunctival surface. The use of brushes to sample the cells on the conjunctival surface is described. The effect of repeated daily challenges on the reaction is also reported.
The presence of activators(AMP and sulphate) or inhibitors(acetyl-CoA) has no influence on the Hill coefficient of the S-shaped [pyruvate]--velocity curve of either the pyruvate-NAD+ overall reaction(h equals 2.5) or that of the pyruvate-K3Fe(CN)6 ACTIVITY OF THE FIRST ENZYME (H EQUALs 1.3). pH STUDIES INDICATED THAT THE Hill coefficient is dependent on subunit ionization within the pyruvate-containing complex and not on those in the free complex. It is concluded that pyruvate conversion rather that pyruvate binding is responsible for the allosteric pattern. The activity is due to absence of a protein kinase, mainly regulated at the acetyl-CoA/CoA, and NADH/NAD+ levels and by the value of the energy charge.
Hemodynamic studies (using (131)I-labeled albumin [RISA]) Were performed before and 5 and 42 weeks after the oral administration of pindolol (av. 30 mg/day), oxprenolol (av. 216 mg/day), propranolol (av. 75 mg/day) or bufetolol hydrochloride (av. 30 mg/day) in 40 patients with essential hypertension. Responders to the antihypertensive actions of short-term (5 weeks) pindolol or bufetolol showed a reduction in total peripheral resistance (pindolol, from av. 2622 to 2022 dyne-sec-cm-5-m2; befetolol, from av. 3301 to 2620, p less than 0.05), without significant changes in cardiac index, while hypotensive actions of propranolol or oxprenolol appeared to be due mainly to a decrease in cardiac output (propranolol, from av. 4.03 to 2.99 L/min/m2; oxprenolol, from av. 3.97 to 3.29 L/min/m2), although the decrease in cardiac output was not significant. In long-term (42 weeks) oxprenolol therapy, antihypertensive effects seemed to be related to reduced cardiac output and a readaptation of peripheral resistance to chronic reduction of cardiac output was not always observed. Circulation time was determined in 9 patients with oxprenolol therapy and 8 with pindolol therapy by the measurement of the arrival time in the cerebral hemisphere of the intravenously injected radioisotope. The patients with oxprenolol therapy showed significant prolongation in circulation time (short-term administration, av. 6.6 to 8.4 sec; long-term administration av. 6.6 to 9.2 sec, p less than 0.05), while no prolongation was observed in pindolol therapy. These results suggest that hemodynamic responses to beta-blocking agents are not uniform and that the antihypertensive actions of beta-blockers depend on the effects on both cardiac output and peripheral vascular resistance.
125I-Iodohydroxybenzylpindolol ([125I] IHYP), a potent beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, has been used to study beta-adrenergic receptors in rat brain. Binding of [125I] IHYP (30 pM) to a membrane fraction min and dissociation took place with a half time of about 16 min. Phentolamine (10(-4) M) decreased non-receptor binding but it had no effect on the binding of [125I] IHYP to beta-adrenergic receptors in cortex, cerebellum or caudate. In the presence of phentolamine specific binding (defined as binding which was blocked by 0.3 muM dl-propranolol) represented 70-85% of total binding. The binding of [125I] IHYP was inhibited by beta-adrenergic agonists and antagonists. d-Stereoisomers were 2-3 orders of magnitude less potent than the corresponding 1-isomers. The denstiy of [125I] IHYP binding sites was studied in membrane fractions from cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and caudate nucleus by means of Scatchard analysis. The K(D) of [125I] IHYP was similar in the three regions studied, and the density of [125I] IHYP binding sites was approximately 50% greater in the cortex and caudate than in the cerebellum. The Hill coefficient for the binding of [125I] IHYP to membranes from cerebral cortex was 1.02. The properties of the binding of [125I] IHYP are similar to those which would be expected of binding to beta-adrenergic receptors in vitro.
The molar absorptivity of NADH at 340 nm has been determined by an indirect procedure in which high-purity glucose is phosphorylated by ATP in the presence of hexokinase, coupled to oxidation of the glucose-6-phosphate by NAD+ in the presence of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. The average value from 85 independent determinations is 6317 liter mol-1 cm-1 at 25 degrees C and pH 7.8. The overall uncertainty is -4.0 to +5.5 ppt (6292 to 6352 liter mol-1 cm-1), based on a standard error of the mean of 0.48 ppt and an estimate of systematic error of -2.6 to +4.1 ppt. Effects of pH, buffer, and temperature on the molar absorptivity are also reported.
A lichen planus-like eruption was seen in four patients after bone marrow transplantation. The skin and mucous membrane appearance closely mimicked lichen planus. The histopathology was also very similar to lichen planus. The occurrence of a lichen planus-like eruption (LPLE) after an immune basal cell damage related to the graft-versus-host reaction raised the question of the immune nature of this eruption. The correlation found between biological signs of graft-versus-host reaction and the out-break or relapse of the lichen planus-like eruption supports the hypothesis that the skin changes could be a sign of a chronic immune response against recipient epidermis.
Strains of Diplococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae were tested for susceptibility to numerous antibiotics by a twofold agar dilution method using an inocula replicator. Undiluted, fully grown broth cultures were used as inocula for both species, and cultures of pneumococci diluted 1:1,000 were also tested. The antibiotics included most of those in common use in the United States as well as some chemical modifications recently approved and others that are under investigation. The most striking aspect of the results was the marked susceptibility of the pneumococci to all the antibiotics tested except the polymyxins and most of the aminoglycoside antibiotics, although some new aminoglycosides were active in quite low concentrations. Some of the strains of pneumococci were of decreased susceptibility to penicillin G (minimal inhibitory concentrations, 0.2 to 0.4 mug/ml), but none were tetracycline resistant, although such strains had been reported previously from this laboratory. The strains of H. influenzae, which were all serologically nontypable, exhibited different patterns of susceptibility to the groups of antibiotics and to the individual chemically related ones. None of these strains (isolated early in 1972) were ampicillin resistant. The most active agents against H. influenzae were: carbenicillin and ampicillin, analogues related to each of them, rifampin, chloramphenicol, and the polymyxins. However, the tetracycline analogues other than tetracycline, some aminoglycosides, notably tobramycin, kanamycin, gentamicin, and verdamicin, erythromycin, and some new lincomycin analogues were also active in low concentrations. Trimethoprim alone was highly active, and in combination with sulfamethoxazole it was even more active and synergistic against strains of both D. pneumoniae and H. influenzae.
The interaction between Parafilm and four tranquilizers in their neutral phosphate buffer solutions resulted in various degrees of loss of the drugs from the solutions. The values of loss ranged from 15 to 34% for chlorpromazine and 8 to 42% for butaperazine at the initial concentration range of 2 to 20 mug/ml at room temperature (22 +/- 1 degree C). Under the same conditions, the values of loss from saliva for these two drugs were fairly constant; about 25% and 17%, respectively. For diazepam and chlordiazepoxide, the losses from the buffer solution were below 5%.
From a crude extract of chick peas (Cicer arietinum L.) inhibitors of trypsin and chymotrypsin were isolated by affinity chromatography on a column of trypsin-Sepharose 6B. The content of inhibitors was found to be 1.5 g/kg. They were further separated into six isoinhibitors by ion-exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex A-25. Two of the isoinhibitors accounted for about 50% of the isolated inhibitors and were further purified to a homogeneous state. The isoinhibitors had a molecular weight of about 10000 as determined by molecular-sieve chromatography on Sephadex G-75. They were stable towards extremes of pH and temperatures up to 75 degrees C or towards digestion by pepsin. They were also stable in 6 M urea but not in 6 M guanidine-HCl. The intact inhibitors were destroyed when the peas were cooked at 100 degrees C or when they were toasted at 130 degrees C. The four major inhibitors had similar amino acid compositions and did not contain detectable amounts of free sulfhydryl groups, tryptophan or carbohydrate. Cysteine is the dominant amino acid residue in all of them and accounted for about 20% of their amino acid content. The isoelectric point of the isoinhibitors lies in the range of pH 4.9-8.6 and two of the major inhibitors had isoelectric points of pH 4.75 and pH 4.96. They inhibited chymotrypsin to the same extent but differed in their inhibitory activities towards trypsin, indicating that they are mixtures of native and trypsinmodified forms and that they probably have separate sites for the two enzymes. They did not inhibit other proteolytic enzymes belonging to two groups (i.e., serine or cysteine enzymes) or originating from different sources (i.e., animals, plants or bacteria).
In acute experiments on 92 cats anesthetized with Urethane and kept under controlled respiration the mechanism of tonic activity of the pulmonary vessels was studied in the presence of a decreased partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli. The tonicity of the pulmonary vessels was recorded during autoperfusion of the vessels of the posterior lobe of the left lung by means of a perfusion pump. Simultaneously, the pressure in the common carotid artery was recorded and the oxygen saturation of the blood was measured. Pharmacological analysis was used for the study of the mechanism of the pressor reaction of the pulmonary vessels under hypoxic hypoxy, and it demonstrated that the pression of the pulmonary vessels that develops under alveolar hypoxy is less distinct under the effect of the ganglioblocking agent Benzo-hexonium, as well as the myotropic agents Papaverine and Chloracizine. The above reaction was significantly inhibited by the blocking agents of the D- and M-serotonin-reactive structures -- Dihydroergothamine, Morphine and Novocain, and it was completely lacking against the background of the action of Izadrine and Dimedrol -- blocking agents of serotonin- and histamine-reactive structures. It can be supposed that the D- and M-serotonin-reactive, and probably also the histamine-reactive structures participate in the regulation of the interrelationship of ventilation and pulmonary circulation.
A sodium dependent specific transport system for phosphate is present in the brush border microvilli but absent from the basal-lateral plasma membranes. The apparent affinity of this transport system for phosphate is 0.08 mM at 100 mM sodium and pH 7.4. It is inhibited competitively by arsenate with an apparent inhibitor constant of 1.1 mM (100 mM sodium, pH 7.4). Sodium dependent phosphate uptake is two times higher at pH 8 compared to the uptake observed at pH 6. The apparent affinity of the transport system for sodium is also pH-dependent, half-maximal stimulation of uptake is found at pH 6 with 129 mM sodium, at pH 7.4 with 60 mM sodium and at pH 8 with 50 mM sodium. Under all conditions a nonhyperbolic dependence of phosphate uptake on the sodium concentration is observed. The uptake of phosphate by brush border microvilli vesicles shows a typical overshoot phenomenon in the presence of sodium gradient across the membrane (CNao greater than CNai). The amount of pohsphate taken up after 2 min is about twice the equilibrium value reached after 2 h of incubation. At pH 7.4 the initial rate of uptake is increased only slighyly (12%) by inside negative membrane diffusion potentials and inhibited to the same extent by inside positive membrane diffusion potentials. These results indicate that the entry of phosphate across the brush border membrane into the epithelial cell of the proximal tubule is coupled to the entry of sodium. The transfer of phosphate is dependent on its concentration gradient and on the concentration difference of sodium. The data are best explained by the following hypothesis: Both the primary phosphate as well as the secondary phosphate are transported in cotransport with sodium. The divalent form however seems to be transported preferentially. Its transport occurs electroneutral with 2 sodium ions; the monovalent phosphate also enters the cell together with 2 sodium ions but as a positively charged complex. The exit of phosphate across the contraluminal cell border is sodium independent and is favoured by the high intracellular phosphate concentration and the inside negative membrane potential.
In 24 patients (16 women, 8 men, mean age 60 years), who underwent abdominal operations and who had a uncomplicated postoperative course, a teflon-tube was inserted into the portal vein at the end of laparotomy and remained there for maximal 9 days. The mean values of the portal venous pressure as well as of the portal-central venous pressure gradient are unchanged during the period of all 9 days and are between 7,4 and 7,9 mmHg, between 5,6 and 6,9 mmHg respectively. The arterio-portal venous 0(2)-content difference shows in the mean no fluctuations and is about 2 Vol.%. On the first postoperative day the lactic and pyruvic acid concentrations in the artery and portal vein are moderately, but significantly elevated and decrease to normal values until day 7. - 9.
The interaction between tRNAPhe (yeast), from which the Y-base has been removed by acid treatment, and phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase (yeast) has been investigated by fluorescence competition titrations and sedimentation velocity runs. The binding parameters are given under various ionic conditions. The tRNAPhe-Y still can occupy the specific binding sites on the enzyme. Compared to unmodified tRNAPhe, the binding constant is lowered by more than one order of magnitude. It can be concluded that the Y-base is not necessary for specific recognition of tRNAPhe by the cognate synthetase, it rather may represent a point of attachment for the synthetase.
In white rats both adapted and unadapted to cold, the RQ dynamics during cold exposure, noradrenaline and ganglion blocking agent administration, were studied. The adapted animals' RQ in thermoneutral conditions was shown to be a little higher than in the control rats; 0.5 mg/kg noradrenaline injections induced a clear RQ decrease in the former and did not influence the latters' RQ. Cold exposure was followed by a RQ decrease in both. Ganglion blocking agent administration decreased the RQ in the adapted animals and prevented it from falling in the control those. Noradrenaline is supposed to be the main but not the only factor activating lipolysis in the cold adapted animals.
Adenylate cyclase [ATP pyrophosphate-lyase (cyclizing), EC 4.6.1.1] activity of purified secretory vesicle membranes from the adrenal medulla is inhibited by I-isoproterenol and I-epinephrine, as well as by nerve growth factor (NGF). The effect of these agents was found to be dose-dependent and, in the case of the catecholamines, saturable. NGF was active at concentrations as low as 10(-8) M. Oxidized NGF was only minimally active, and insulin was completely inactive. Neither dopamine nor phenylephrine had activity. Inhibition of cyclase by either isoproterenol or epinephrine was blocked by I-propranolol, a specific beta-antagonist, but propranolol by itself had no effect on adenylate cyclase activity. The data indicate that the secretory vesicle membrane has beta-adrenergic receptors coupled to the adenylate cyclase. Propranolol was also found to block the NGF-induced inhibition of cyclase. We conclude that the granule membrane has beta-adrenergic receptors as well as NGF-reactive sites, and that the two may be functionally linked.
Anticonvulsant drug interactions have been investigated using multiple linear regression analyses. The one statistically significant interaction found was that in which phenytoin dosage decreased plasma carbamazepine concentrations. There was a suggestion that carbamazepine and phenobarb dosage tended to increase phenytoin levels. No interaction was detected between phenytoin and sulthiame. Studies in individuals suggested that ethosuximide may increase plasma phenytoin concentration and that clonazepam tends to decrease carbamazepine and phenytoin concentrations.
The kinetics (region of seconds) of the light-induced 520 nm absorbance changes and its dark reversal have been studied in detail in the wild type and in some pigment and photosynthetic mutants of Scenedesmus obliquus. The following 5 lines of evidence led us to conclude that the signal is entirely due to the photosystem I reaction modified by electron flow from Photosystem II. Gradual blocking of the electron transport with 3(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea resulted in diminution and ultimate elimination of the biphasic nature of the signal without reducing the extent of the absorbance change or of the dark kinetics. On the contrary, blocking electron flow at the oxidizing side of plastoquinone with 2,5-dibromo-3-methyl-6-isoprophyl-p-benzoquinone or inactivating the plastocyanin with KCN, prolonged the dark reversal of the absorbance change apart from abolishing the biphasic nature of the signal. Action spectra clearly indicate that the main signal (I) is due to electron flow in Photosystem I and that its modification (Signal II) is due to the action of Photosystem II. Signal I is pH independent, whereas Signal II demonstrates a strong pH dependence, parallel to the O2-evolving capacity of the cells. Chloroplast particles isolated from the wild type Scenedesmus cells demonstrated in the absence of any added artificial electron donor or acceptor and also under non-phosphorylation conditions the 520 nm absorbance change with approximately the same magnitude as whole cells. The dark kinetics of the particles were comparatively slower. Removal of plastocyanin and other electron carriers by washing with Triton X-100 slowed down the kinetics of the dark reversal reaction to a greater extent. A similar positive absorbance change at 520 nm and slow dark reversal  was also observed in the Photosystem I particles prepared by the Triton method. Mutant C-6E, which contains neither carotenoids nor chlorophyll b and lacks Photosystem II activity, demonstrates a normal signal I of the 520 nm absorbance change. This latter result contradicts the postulate that carotenoids are the possible cause of the 520 nm absorbance change.
When N-[14C] acetylbenzotriazole, presented here as a new agent for the acetylation of proteins, reacted at pH 8 and 25 degrees C with delta-chymotrypsin, 15 amino groups (the epsilon-amino groups of lysing residues and the alpha-amino terminus of half-cystine-1) and two phenolic groups (those of the two exposed tyrosine residues) were acetylated with respective pseudo first-order constants of 0.056 +/- 0.003 and 0.15 +/- 0.03 min(-1). Surprisingly, in contrast with the acetic anhydride reaction, the alpha-amino group of Ile-16 was found to be not acetylated as shown by N-terminus determination and activity measurements: the modified delta-chymotrypsin (or acetylated delta-chymotrypsin) was fully active after neutral dialysis. Only a transient inactivation due to the incorporation of one [14C] acetyl group per mole of catalytic site was observed. The kinetic constant found for reactivation at pH 8.5 was 0.315 +/- 0.005 min(-1) at 25 degrees C. The enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of N-acetylbenzotriazole was described by a k(cat) value of 0.093 +/- 0.005 min(-1) at pH 7 and 25 degrees C. Circular dichroism changes observed at 230 nm during the reaction at pH 8.5, of acetylated delta-chymotrypsin with N-acetylbenzotriazole indicated a total conversion of the amount of enzyme molecules which were in the 'inactive' or 'alkaline' conformation at this pH, into the 'active' or 'neutral' one. Benzotriazole alone was unable to induce such a conformational change. The rate constant of the reverse structural process from the 'neutral' to the 'alkaline' conformation was 0.32 +/- 0.02 min(-1): identical to that of the deacetylation of the catalytic site. Thus, the unusual lack of acetylation of Ile-16 alpha-amino group during delta-chymotrypsin treatment with N-acetylbenzotriazole is interpreted as a stabilization of the enzyme 'neutral' conformation where the Ile-16 alpha-amino group is buried, thus inaccessible to the reagent. The properties of the delta-chymotrypsin modification using N-acetylbenzotriazole led to practical uses: direct spectrophotometric titration of chymotrypsin operational normality at pH 7 and rapid preparation of acetylated delta-chymotrypsin. As a protein reagent, N-acetylbenzotriazole is particularly interesting because of its reactivity towards amino and phenolic groups of amino acid residues, its stability at acid pH, i.e., k(hydrolysis=7.38 X 10(-3) min(-1) at 25 degrees C [Ravaux et al. (1971) Tetrahedron Letters, 4013-4015] and its aromaticity, responsible for optical properties.
A simple method was described for the preparation of 125I-labeled type III neumococcal polysaccharide (SSS-III) with a high specific radioactivity which retained the physical and immunologic properties of native SSS-III. SSS-III was used to study the serum and tissue levels of antigen, as well as its excretion, after i.p. injection. When an optimally immunogenic dose (0.5 mug) of antigen was given, greater than 90% of the injected antigen was excreted during the first 3 days after injection; however, after day 3, the SSS-III which remained in each mouse was firmly bound to various tissues, and less than 5 ng SSS-III was released into the circulation daily. SSS-III was also used in a Farr test to measure serum antibody levels; the kinetics for the appearance of PFC/spleen and serum antibody levels were measured at 24-hr intervals after immunization with 0.5 mug of antigen. Maximum PFC/spleen were observed on day 4 after immunization whereas the peak serum antibody level was seen on day 5. The decay of serum antibody level from its maximum value was much slower than that of the PFC/spleen. The data describing the distribution of SSS-III in vivo and the measurement of serum antibody levels indicated that treadmill neutralization was not a factor in determining the serum antibody levels after immunization with an optimally immunogenic dose of SSS-III.
It is very important to evaluate the degree of maturity of a new-born infant in order: - to appreciate the chronological age when the date of the last period is unknown or doubtful, - to compare the degree of maturation with the weight and size of the infant, in regard of estimating the intra-uterine growth and detecting early a lateness or advance of this growth.
Experiments were carried out to define the kinetic parameters of the major phosphate transport processes of rat liver mitochondria, and to obtain information about the molecular properties of these systems.
An experimental model of allergic lung disease has been described that is monitored by analysis of arterial oxygen tension following aerosol challenge with antigen. Rabbits immunized to a classical soluble antigen, human serum albumin (HSA), to the point where severe Arthus skin reactivity was demonstrable, were aerosol-challenged with antigen. Arterial oxygen tension measurements made on pre- and post-challenge samples yielded early, late, and continuous response patterns, reminiscent of those obtained in humans following provocation testing. Aerosol challenge of unimmunized animals with HSA resulted in no change from baseline conditions. Unimmunized rabbits exposed to small and massive (10X) aerosols of Aspergillus spores also demonstrated various postchallenge depressions in arterial oxygen tension as well as decreased levels in hemolytic complement activity, depending on the species of fungus and dose of spores used. Unimmunized animals pretreated with cobra venom factor in a manner known to achieve complement depletion failed to respond with altered arterial oxygen tensions following similar aerosol challenge. It is postulated that although precipitins may play a role in artificial disease initiated by soluble antigens, nonspecific complement activation may be more important in understanding the etiology of spontaneous disease in humans brought about by inhalation of moldy particulate matter.
The new sexual therapy, a brief outpatient treatment of sexual dysfunction consisting of structured sexual exercises and conjoint therapeutic sessions, is a systematic intergration of behavioral and psychodynamic elements. Formally consisting of many defining characteristics of a behavior therapy including the direct treatment of a specified problem and the application of behavioral principles, the new sex therapy also relies on psychodynamic understanding. The result is synergistic. Psychodynamic understanding underlies appropriate behavioral intervention, and psychodynamic exploration of resistance enhances the effectiveness of behavioral methods. Behavioral techniques facilitate the most rapid implementation of therapeutic insight. The integration of approaches in the new sex therapy has general significance for psychotherapeutic theory and practice.
The effects of luminal addition of salicylate and taurocholate on ion transport by fundic mucosa were examined in vitro using isotopic and pH stat techniques. Salicylate, 3 mM, did not alter, but 20 mM caused a 40% decrease in, the acid secretory rate. Taurocholate, 20 mM, caused a transient, apparent cessation of acid secretion followed by stimulation. Salicylate, 3 or 20 mM, increased Na+ but not Cl- permeability at luminal pH 7. At luminal pH 4, however, salicylate increased Cl- in addition to Na+ and H+ permeability. Taurocholate, 10 or 20 mM, increased both cation and anion permeability at pH 7 and 4. Addition of salicylate or taurocholate results in stimulation of net Na+ transport. While salicylate and taurocholate increase cation permeability at pH 7, they have differing effects on acid secretion and anion permeability. The data suggest that salicylate and taurocholate alter cation permeability by different mechanisms and are consistent with the concept that enhanced diffusion of H+ into the tissue causes a nonspecific alteration in the permeability pathway.
The spontaneous inactivation of yeast glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was found to fit a simple two-state model at pH 8.5 and 25 degrees. The first step is a relatively rapid dissociation of the tetramer to dimers with the equilibrium largely in favor of the tetramer. In the absence of NAD+ the dimer inactivates irreversibly. The apoenzyme is quite stable with a half-life for complete activity loss proportional to the square root of the enzyme concentration. Perturbances of the protein structure (by pH, ionic strength, and specific salts), which have no effect on the tetrameric state of the molecule, result in an alteration of the cooperativity of NAD+ binding, the reactivity of the active-site sulfhydryl group, and the catalytic activity of the enzyme. Covalent modification of two of the four active-site sulfhydryl groups has profound effects on the enzymic activity which are mediated by changes in the subunit interactions. Sedimentation analysis and hybridization studies indicate that the interaction between subunits remains strong after covalent modification. Under normal physiological and equilibrium dialysis conditions the protein is a tetramer. Equilibrium dialysis studies of NAD+ binding to the enzyme at pH 8.5 and 25 degrees reveal a mixed cooperativity pattern. A model consistent with these observations and the observed half-of-the-sites reactivity is that of ligand induced sequential conformational changes which are transferred across strongly interacting subunit domains. Methods for distinguishing negatively cooperative binding patterns from mixtures of denatured enzyme and multiple species are discussed.
Mn2+ uptake in the chick chorioallantoic membrane, an embryonic epithelial tissue which transports Ca2+ in vivo was studied using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). Mn2+ was used as a paramagnetic analog for Ca2+, since there is evidence that Mn2+ is accumulated by the Ca2+ transport mechanism. After 1.5 h of uptake the EPR spectrum of the Mn2+ in the membrane indicated that 89% of the Mn2+ was in a spin-exchange form, indicating close packing of Mn2+. The Mn2+ spacing was estimated from the line width to be about 4.7 A. The remaining Mn2+ was very likely Mn2+ hexahydrate. At pH 7.4 the spin-exchange spectrum tended to broaden when uptake was inhibited, while at pH 5.0 the spin-exchange spectrum was completely abolished in the presence of inhibitors. The EPR spectrum of Mn2+ in the chorioallantoic membrane had a broader line width than that of Mn2+ in isolated mitochondria, suggesting that in this tissue mitochondria are not directly involved in divalent cation transport. These EPR studies support the concept that divalent cations are sequestered in high concentrations from the rest of the cell contents during transcellular active transport.
Pulmonary artery and pulmonary wedge pressures were measured at rest and during exercise in 25 young patients with moderate to severe scoliosis. Simultaneous determinations of arterial blood gases and pH were performed. The results of the vascular pressure measurements were compared with those obtained in 15 healthy young subjects. In all patients the pulmonary artery and pulmonary wedge pressure were normal at rest. During mild ergometer exercise, however, an abnormal rise in pulmonary artery pressure occurred in 9 patients. Moreover, an increased diastolic pressure gradient across the pulmonary vascular bed was found in some scoliotic patients indicating an elevated pulmonary vascular resistance. It is supposed that this haemodynamic abnormality is primarily due to a restriction of the pulmonary vascular bed. Relationships between pulmonary artery pressure and arterial oxygen tension and blood pH, respectively, could be found. The possible significance of these results is discussed.
Lipolysis and cyclic AMP accumulation were studied in isolated rat fat cells at normal (7.4) and decreased (7.0, 6.6) pH. Acidosis inhibited lipolysis and cyclic AMP accumulation due to NA non-competetively. Maximal lipolysis (3 muM NA) was inhibited by 25% at pH 7.0 and by 61% at pH 6.6 Cyclic AMP accumulation 5 min after 3 muM NA was inhibited by 57% at pH 7.0 and by 83% at pH 6.6. Between 10 and 60 minutes of incubation NA-stimulated lipolysis was linear at pH 7.4, whereas a progressively increasing inhibition was seen at lower pH. The FFA production was inhibited to the same degree as glycerol production by acidosis. The fraction of FFA associated with the cells was the same at all pHs. Thus, we have no evidence that acidosis inhibits lipolysis via accumulation of FFA intracellularly. NA-induced accumulation of 3H-cAMP from 3H-ATP, endogenously formed by prelabelling the cells with 3H-adenine, was inhibited by acidosis both in the presence and absence of theophylline in the incubation medium (by 48 and 44% respectively at pH 7.0 and by 74 and 68% at pH 6.6). Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase in homogenates of fat cells was inhibited by decreasing the pH, whether measured at high or low substrate concentrations. Basal adenylyl cyclase activity in a cell membrane fraction from fat cells was affected to a minor degree, while NA-stimulated activity was inhibited by decreased pH. The response to 3 muM NA at pH 6.6 was inhibited by 43% relative to control. The results show that acidosis inhibits NA-induced cyclic AMP accumulation by interfering with the formation, rather than the inactivation of the nucleotide. Since NA-induced lipolysis is a cyclic AMP-mediated process it is suggested that at least part of the antilipolytic effect of acidosis is due to inhibition of cyclic AMP formation.
Photosystem II reaction center components have been studied in small system II particles prepared with digitonin. Upon illumination the reduction of the primary acceptor was indicated by absorbance changes due to the reduction of a plastoquinone to the semiquinone anion and by a small blue shifts of absorption bands near 545 nm (C550) and 685 nm. The semiquinone to chlorophyll ratio was between 1/20 and 1/70 in various preparations. The terminal electron donor in this reaction did not cause large absorbance changes but its oxidized form was revealed by a hitherto unknown electron spin resonance (ESR) signal, which had some properties of the well-known signal II but a linewidth and g-value much nearer to those of signal I. Upon darkening absorbance and ESR changes decayed together in a cyclic or back reaction which was stimulated by 3-(3,4 dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea. The donor could be oxidized by ferricyanide in the dark. Illumination in the presence of ferricyanide induced absorbance and ESR changes, rapidly reversed upon darkening, which may be ascribed to the oxidation of a chlorophyll a dimer, possibly the primary electron donor of photosystem II. In addition an ESR signal with 15 to 20 gauss linewidth and a slower dark decay was observed, which may have been caused by a secondary donor.
The kinetics of protein fluorescence change exhibited by ADP or orthophosphate addition to the Mg2+-or Mn2+-activated unadenylylated glutamine synthetase from Escherichia coli were studied. The kinetic patterns of these reactions are incompatible with a simple bimolecular binding process and a mechanism which required protein isomerization prior to substrate binding. They are consistent with a mechanism in which direct substrate binding is followed by a substrate-induced conformational change step, ES in equilibrium ES. At pH 7.0 and 15 degrees C, the association constants for the direct binding (K1) of ADP to MnE1.0 and of Pi to MnE1.0ADP are 3.9 X 10(4) and 2.28 X 10(2) M(-1), respectively. The association constant for the direct binding of ADP to MnE1.0Pi is 2.3 X 10(4) M(-1) at pH 7.0 and 19 degrees C. The deltaG degrees for the substrate-induced conformational step are -3.5 and -1.3 kcal mol(-1) due to ADP binding to MnE1.0Pi and MnE1.0, respectively, and -1.4 kcal mol(-1) due to Pi binding to MnE1.0ADP. Rate constants, k2 and k(-2), for the isomerization step are: 90 and 9.5 s(-1) for ADP binding to MnE1.0, 440 and 0.36 s(-1) for ADP binding to MnE1.0Pi, and 216 and  1.8 s(-1) for Pi binding to MnE1.0ADP. Due to low substrate affinity, the association constant for direct Pi binding to MnE1.0 was roughly estimated to be 230 M(-1) and k2 = 750 s(-1), k(-2) = 250 s(-1). At 9 degrees C and pH 7.0, the estimated association constants for the direct ADP binding to MgE1.0 and MgE1.0 Pi are 1.8 X 10(4) and 1.6 X 10(4) M(-1), respectively; and the rate constants for the isomerization step associated with the corresponding reaction are k2 = 550 s(-1), k(-2) = 500 s(-1), and k2 = 210 s(-1), k(-2) = 100 s(-1). From the kinetic analysis it is evident that the inability of Mn2+ to support biosynthetic activity of the unadenylylated enzyme is due to the slow rate of ADP release from the MnE1.0PiADP complex. In contrast the large k(-2) obtained for ADP release from the MgE1.0ADP or MgE1.0PiADP complex indicates that this step is not rate limiting in the biosynthesis of glutamine since the k catalysis obtained under the same conditions is 7.2 s(-1).
The ability of narcotic antagonists to produce the narcotic cue was investigated in rats trained to discriminate fentanyl (0.04 mg/kg) from solvent. The partial antagonists pentazocine, cyclazocine and nalorphine were found to possess narcotic cuing activity whereas naloxone lacked any such action at doses up to 160 mg/kg. The relationship between the present findings and the ability of these drugs to produce opiate-like subjective effects in humans is discussed. The conclusion was reached that the experimental procedure used may contribute significantly to the preclinical evaluation of drug abuse liability.
Seventy-seven (0.24%) of 32,005 admissions to the Massachusetts General Hospital pediatric service during the period 1962 to 1973 were due to accidental poisoning. In 27 cases, mostly involving children less than 6 years of age, psychotropic drugs were implicated. These included sedative-hypnotics in six cases, phenytoin in two, major tranquilizers in five, antidepressants in three, stimulants or hallucinogens in three, and drug mixtures in eight. Toxicologic analyses contributed little to diagnosis and initial management. Except for one child who ingested ferrous sulfate, no patient was seriously intoxicated, and all recovered rapidly without sequelae. Although referral of serious poisoning cases to another hospital may have biased the results, the findings suggest that accidental psychotropic drug poisoning is not a major source of childhood morbidity.
Testicular function was determined in 29 men, 21 to 35 years old, who had undergone orchiopexy for unilaterally undescended testis at four to 12 years of age. Serum testosterone and dialyzable testosterone concentrations of these men were not significantly different from those of a control group of 30 normal men, and their basal serum luteinizing hormone concentrations and serum luteinizing hormone responses to synthetic gonadotropin-releasing hormone were only slightly higher than those of the normal men. The mean sperm density of the patients, however, was only one third of that of the normal men (p less than 0.001). The mean serum follicle stimulating hormone response ro gonadotropin-releasing hormone of the patients was doubled that of the normal men (p less than 0.001). The data indicate that spermatogenesis may be abnormal after orchipexy, and suggest that men with unilaterally undescended testis may have bilateral testicular abnormality.
The sterol compositions of three oceanic jellyfish have been determined using gas chromatographic mass spectrometric techniques involving the use of two separate gas chromatographic column systems. The components in overlapping peaks have been identified by comparison of the mass spectra of peaks in the two column systems using subtractive techniques. A mid-water animal, Periphylla periphylla, was found to contain a very complex and unusual sterol profile including rare 5alpha-stanols, whereas two other oceanic jellyfish Pelagia noctiluca and Atolla wyvillei contained similar mixtures of delta5 sterols to those previously isolated from coastal species.
Dopamine was used in a dose of 5 mug/kg/min in ten infants with congenital cardiopathy and presenting in the immediate postoperative period a syndrome of low cardiac output. The output was not measured but, based on the evolution of the clinical signs, six favourable results, with correction of the syndrome, can be reported.
The nature of the inhibitory effects of the major metabolite of diphenylhydantoin, 5-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-5-phenylhydantoin (HPPH), on the in vitro metabolism of ethylmorphine and aniline by rat hepatic microsomes was examined. The N-demethylation of ethylmorphine was competitively inhibited by HPPH, whereas inhibition of the hydroxylation of aniline was not competitive. The spectrum produced by HPPH when added to microsomal suspensions does not resemble the classical type I or type II spectra, but rather a reversed type I spectrum. Spectral evidence is presented indicating that HPPH also diminishes the magnitude of the spectral change produced by type I and II compounds.
Neurotransmitter-receptor binding sites for apparent muscarinic cholinergic, beta-adrenergic, gamma-aminobutyric acid and serotonin receptors were measured in the caudate nucleus and frontal cerebral cortex from post-mortem brains of 16 patients with Huntington's chorea and 16 controls. In addition, the samples were assayed for the gamma-aminobutyric-acid-synthesizing enzyme, glutamic acid decarboxylase, and for the acetylcholine-synthesizing enzyme, choline acetyltransferase. In the caudate nucleus of choreic brain, both enzyme activities were markedly lower, with significant decreases in muscarinic cholinergic and serotonin receptor binding, whereas enzyme activities and receptor binding were unchanged in the cerebral cortex. By contrast, gamma-aminobutyric acid and beta-adrenergic receptor binding were not significantly different in choreic and control caudate nucleus or cortex, suggesting that, despite the loss of gamma-aminobutyric-acid-synthesizing ability in the corpus striatum, gamma-aminobuytric acid mimetic drugs might alleviate the movement disorders in Huntington's chorea.
Miconazole, a potent antifungal agent, labilizes rat liver lysosomes. Its labilizing effect is followed by measuring the release of lysosomal hydrolases, namely, acid phosphatase, beta-glucuronidase, and arylsulfatase A. The effect of miconazole is concentration dependent in the range of 10(-5) to 1.2 x 10(-4) M. However, at higher concentrations, miconazole inhibits enzyme release but does not inhibit enzyme activities per se. The effect of miconazole depends on the drug/lysosome ratio and is influenced by the pH of the incubation media, being minimal at alkaline pH. Membrane-active drugs such as nystatin, 2-phenethyl-alcohol, hexachlorophene, and digitonin have been compared with miconazole for their lysosome-labilizing action. The effect of miconazole on the lysosomal membrane is confirmed by a decrease in turbidity of the lysosomal suspension.
The inhibitory effect of alkylboronic acids H(CH2)nB(OH)2(n=2-8) and Ph(CH2)n-B(OH)2, (n=0-4), on the alkaline mesentericopeptidase-catalysed hydrolysis of synthetic substrates was studied. It was shown that alkylboronic acids act as bifunctional reversible inhibitors. The borate group interacts with an ionogenic group of the enzyme with a pKa of about 6.9-7.0. The latter is probably the catalytically active imidazole of the active centre. The hydrocarbon part of the molecule also takes part in the formation of the enzyme-inhibitor complex. The dependence of the degree of the enzyme-inhibitor complex formation upon the length of the side-chain of the inhibitor indicates the presence of two binding sites on the enzyme molecule.
This report is an attempt to study the renal handling of chromium under in vitro conditions and to relate this to the actions of the ion in the production of nephrotoxicity. Renal slice techniques were employed in these studies and were used to examine the effects of chromium on various renal transport processes. In addition, the accumulation of chromium by the renal tissue has also been studied. Marked accumulation by renal cortical slices of the rat was observed when 51Cr-labeled chromate or dichromate was added to the bathing solution. Some metabolic inhibitors interfered with this uptake process; in addition, some substrates metabolized by renal tissue reduced the accumulation of 51Cr. The use of [51Cr] dichromate and [51Cr]-chromate, as well as alterations in the bathing solution pH, indicated that in the rat chromium can interfere with renal transport processes, but that the oxidation state of this metal is not important. On the other hand, in the rabbit a greater interference with 51Cr uptake was noted at lower bathing solution pHs. This is interpreted to mean that chromate is the effective inhibitor in this species.
The decontaminating effect of the pulsing magnetic field on the E. coli infected reclaimed water was studied on two installations. The magnetic field intensity was 500 and 1000-1500 ersted and the microbial load was 1, 10 and 100 thous. microbial units per 1 ml. It was found that the magnetic treatment of water had a noticeable bactericidal effect. This indicated that the method can be used for decontamination of reclaimed water.
Amputation is maybe the oldest and most frequent surgical intervention. After the review of the concept of rehabilitation, its methods and the improvement of the rehabilitation technique the earling opinions in respect of the height of the amputation, the surgical technique and the post-operative treatment - the use of a prosthesis included - are discussed by the author.
Histological and histochemical methods were used to study the ovaries of Greenland seal (Pagophoca groenlandica) from birth-time up to 30 years of age and mature females of Phoca vitulina and Erignathus barbatus. The ovary of the new-born Greenland seal has fetal medullary substance which is a provisory endocrinous gland producing not only sex hormones but also corticosteron. In other species of seals the intestinal cells of the medullary substance are the equivalent of this gland. Within 3-4 weeks after birth the reduction of the fetal medullary substance is completed, it is substituted by the connective tissue and the ovary acquires its typical structure. The rest of the fetal medullary substance is in the depth of the cortex and near the infundibulum of the ovary as lipofuscincontaining cells. When the maturation period approaches, the process of the follicle atresia regularly changes: the epithelium dies quicker, and the multiplication of intestinal cells increases. The ovaries of seals are rich in interstitial cells. Their amount cyclically changes. The cells producing steroid hormones always well hydrolize AS naphthyl-phosphates, the reaction with glycerophosphate is more variable. The connective tissue is poor in acid mucopolysaccharides, its amorphous substance in the ovary cortex is rich in protein. Senile changes of the ovary are noticed in the seal beginning from 20 years of age.
1. Chloroplasts isolated from leaves of spinach-beet (Beta vulgaris L. ssp. vulgaris) do not catalyse the hydroxylation of p-coumaric acid in the dark unless a reductant (such as ascorbate, NADH or NADPH) is added. Superoxide dismutase has no effect on this reaction. 2. Illuminated chloroplasts catalyse the hydroxylation in the absence of added reductant. This reaction is completely inhibited by superoxide dismutase, but catalase has little effect. 3. Both hydroxylation in the light and hydroxylation in the dark in the presence of reductants are inhibited by diethyldithiocarbamate, EDTA, cyanide and 2-mercaptoethanol. 4. It is proposed that O-2- generated by illuminated chloroplasts is involved in the provision of a reductant to the enzyme phenolase.
We have previoulsy shown pH compensation to be similar in CSF and arterial blood during chronic hypoxemic hypocapnia in man and pony, and postulated that the compensatory reduction in CSF [HCO3] was dependent upon corresponding changes in [HCO3]a. We tested this hypothesis in anesthetized, paralyzed dogs by determining the effects of 7 or 14 hours of hypocapnia (PaCO2 20 and 30 mm Hg), hypoxemia (PaO2 30, 38 and 48 mm Hg) and hypocapnic hypoxemia on CSF acid-base status. [hco3]a was either permitted to fall normally or was held near control levels by NaHCO3 infusion. In hypocapnia and hypoxemic hypocapnia, the decrease in [HCO3] and % pH compensation in CSF were less than or equal to that in arterial blood. Most (51-89%) of the compensatory decrease in CSF [HCO3] was prevented by preventing the corresponding reduction in [HCO3]a. This dependence of changes in CSF on plasma [HCO3] required a concurrent decrease in CSF PCO2, but was largely independent of variations in plasma pH. A minor but significant portion of the decrease in CSF [HCO3] was achieved independently of corresponding changes in [HCO3]a. The contribution of this local mechanism to CSF [HCO3] regulation increased with increasing severity of hypocapnia or hypoxemia and was usually associated with a selective increase in CSF lactate. It was concluded that [HCO3] regulation in the CSF during hypoxemic hypocapnia was primarily dependent upon, and therefore limited by, the concomitant decrease in plasma [HCO3].
The pyruvate carboxylase of Pseudonomas fluorescens was purified 160-fold  from cells grown on glucose at 20 degrees C. The activity of this purified enzyme was not affected by acetyl-coenzyme A or L-aspartate, but was strongly inhibited by ADP, which was competitive towards ATP. Pyruvate gave a broken double reciprocal plot, from which two apparent Km values could be determined, namely 0-08 and 0-21 mM, from the lower and the higher concentration ranges, respectively. The apparent Km for HCO3 at pH 6-9, in the presence of the manganese ATP ion (MnATP2-), was 3-1 mM. The enzyme reaction had an optimum pH value of 7-1 or 9-0 depending on the use of MnATP2- or MgATP2-, respectively, as substrate. Free Mg2+ was an activator at pH values below 9-0. The enzyme was strongly activated by monovalent cations; NH4+ and K+ were the better activators, with apparent Ka values of 0-7 and 1-6 mM, respectively. Partially purified enzymes from cells grown on glucose at 1 or 20 degrees C had the same properties, including the thermal stability. In both cases 50% of the enzyme activity was lost after pre-incubation for 10 min at 46 degrees C. The molecular weight was estimated to be about 300000 daltons by gel filtration on Sephadex G-200. The regulatory properties and molecular weight are thus similar to those determined for the pyruvate carboxylases from Pseudomonas citronellolis and Azotobacter vinelandii.
Stoicheometries and rates of proton translocation associated with respiratory reduction of NO3- have been measured for spheroplasts of Escherichia coli grown anaerobically in the presence of NO3-. Observed stoicheiometries [leads to H+/NO3- ratio; P. Mitchell (1966) Chemiosmotic Coupling in Oxidative and Photosynthetic Phosphorylation, Glynn Research, Bodmin] were approx. 4 for L-malate oxidation and approx. 2 for succinate, D-lactate and glycerol oxidation. Measurements of the leads to H+/2e- ratio with formate as the reductant and oxygen or NO3- as the oxidant were complicated by pH changes associated with formate uptake and CO2 formation. Nevertheless, it was possible to conclude that the site of formate oxidation is on the inner aspect of the cytoplasmic membrane, that the leads to H+/O ratio for formate oxidation is approx. 4, and that the leads to H+/NO3- ratio is greater than 2. Measurements of the rate of NO3- penetration into osmotically sensitive spheroplasts demonstrated an electrogenic entry of NO3- anion. The permeability coefficient for nitrate entry at 30 degrees C was between 10(-9) and 10(-10) cm- s(-1). The calculated rate of nitrate entry at the concentration typically used for the assay of nitrate reductase (EC 1.7.99.4) activity was about 0.1% of that required to support the observed rate of nitrate reduction by reduced Benzyl Viologen. Measurements of the distribution of nitrate between the intracellular and extracellular spaces of a haem-less mutant, de-repressed for nitrate reductase but unable to reduce nitrate by the respiratory chain, showed that, irrespective of the presence or the absence of added glucose, nitrate was not concentrated intracellularly. Osmotic-swelling experiments showed that the rate of diffusion of azid anion across the cytoplasmic membrane is relatively low in comparison with the fast diffusion of hydrazoic acid. The inhibitory effect of azide on nitrate reductase was not altered by treatments that modify pH gradients across the cytoplasmic membrane. It is concluded that the nitrate-reducing azide-sensitive site of nitrate reductase is located on the outer aspect of the cytoplasmic membrane. The consequences of this location for mechanisms of proton translocation driven by nitrate reduction are discussed, and lead to the proposal that the nitrate reductase of the cytoplasmic membrane is vectorial, reducing nitrate on the outer aspect of the membrane with 2H+ and 2e- that have crossed from the inner aspect of the membrane.
ISKEDYL (PF 50), which is sold as a vasoregulator of cerebral irrigation, consists of a mixture of dihydroergocristine and raubasine. This work aims at determining possible interactions between this product and certain drugs used in anesthesia from the cardiovascular point of view. ISKEDYL does not seem to be a contraindication to anesthesia of the "neuroleptic" type, when injected in pre-, per- or post-operative period. A slight temporary and spontaneously reversible fall in arterial blood pressure, affecting both maximum and minimum pressure, together with a decrease in stroke volume and peripheral resistances, estimated by the study of the arterial blood pressure curve, seem to indicate that this product has peripheral vaso-dilatory properties.
Discrete brain areas and sympathetic ganglia obtained at autopsy from patients with idiopathic orthostatic hypotension were assayed for tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine beta-hydroxylase. Dopamine beta-hydroxylase activity was decreased 7.5-fold in sympathetic ganglia, while tyrosine hydroxylase activity was reduced more than 50-fold in the pontine nucleus locus coeruleus. These observations indicate that noradrenergic neurons of both brain and ganglion are affected in idiopathic orthostatic hypotension, but suggest that the central and peripheral biochemical deficits differ.
The environmental control system using superoxides, sillicagels or synthetic ceolites is capable of purifying the atmosphere from microorganisms. The air conditioning system is another means for air purification from microorganisms. The possibility of microbial build-up and multiplication in the atmospheric condensate makes it necessary to assume that an air conditioning system may contribute to the transfer of conditionally pathogenic microorganisms in a space cabin. The reliability of a life support system may degrade due to an accumulation of microorganisms in its components. Further extensive studies are needed to clarify this problem.
Forty-four infants, 2 to 90 days of age, with severe obstructive lesions of the aortic arch, underwent emergency surgical correction between Jan. 1, 1966, and April 1, 1975. The typical clinical presentation was severe congestive heart failure and acidemia. Resection of an aortic coarctation with end-to-end anastomosis was performed in 31 patients. Eight (26 per cent) died after the operation. Since 1969, the mortality rate has been reduced to 14 per cent (3 of 22 patients) even though the incidence of major associated cardiac lesions has remained essentially constant (56 per cent from 1966 through 1969, 64 per cent from 1970 through March, 1975). This suggests that the higher survival rate has resulted from improved surgical techniques and postoperative care. The mortality rate in the infants operated upon during the second and third months of life was twice as high as that in those operated upon before the age of 1 month. Eight patients with Type A interrupted aortic arch were operated upon and 5 survived. Five patients with Type B aortic arch were operated upon and 3 survived.
The following hemodynamic parameters: cardiac frequency, peripheral arterial pressure, pulmonary pressure and cardiac output were measured by direct catheterisation, as the total peripheral vascular resistance and the systolic ejection volume were calculated from the registered results. The cardiac frequency and the pulmonary arterial pressure were practically not modified in our patients, though we have observed a statistically significant decrease of systolic (-30p. 100) and diastolic (-27p. 100) arterial pressure. The total peripheral vascular resistance shows a marked diminution (-20p. 100) after giving Ethrane? for ten minutes. If it is possible that one part, surely important, of the cardiac output, is preserved under Ethrane anesthesia by a significant decrease of the total peripheral vascular resistance, a myocardial depression might be questionned, the decrease of cardiac output at 30 minutes being more important than the decrease of the total peripheral vascular resistance.
After oral administration of 14C-labeled amobarbital to healthy subjects, most of the radioactivity was recovered in urine and only 4-5% in feces over a period of 6 days. No unchanged amobarbital was excreted. Two major metabolites were found and isolated. One was 3'-hydroxyamobarbital, which has been previously identified by Maynert. The second could be identified as N-hydroxyamobarbital on the basis of its spectral and chemical properties.
Two strains independently isolated in Salmonella typhimurium display abnormal autolytic activity when nutrient broth becomes alkaline. They also show increased sensitivity to deoxycholate, EDTA, and sodium dodecyl sulfate. Response to acridine orange remains normal. In both strains a single stable mutation is responsible for all the changes. The same gene, called envD, appears to be involved in both mutant strains. envD has been located at minute 33 of the Salmonella genetic map, between markers sucA and nadA, very close to the latter. envD also affects morphological characteristics of the cells. Many mutant cells are shorter than wild type bacteria, and appear frequently associated in short chains of 4 to 10 cells. Furthermore, envD mutants display division by septation under conditions that preclude its observation in wild type strains.
Metomidate 1 per cent was administered intramuscularly as the sole anaesthetic agent on 22 occasions to seven tawny owls (Strix aluco). Four deaths occurred, none on the first administration. ECG findings and details of dosage are provided. The possible causes of death are discussed.
Through a study of Nitrogen balances, the authors compare the effectiveness of a proteinic intake carried out per os or by intravenous route. The study involved 22 different carcinoma carriers and lasted for 9 days during which the Nitrogen intake was effected either by the digestive tract or by intravenous route supplemented by a sufficient caloric ration. In the latter case, the aminoacid intake was supplied by Trive 1000 combined with glucides and lipids which were then quantitatively deducted from the enteral intake. A study of the results showed that the assimilation of the Nitrogen injected intravenously was very similar to the one obtained by enteral route.
A new medium, which contained a chemically defined tissue culture base ("medium 199"), was developed for the cultivation of mycoplasmas. When supplemented with albumin, glucose, serum, and yeast extract, the new medium adequately supported the growth of Mycoplasma and Acholeplasma species.
A reaction which oligomerizes nucleotides under possible prebiotic conditions has been characterized. Nucleoside monophosphate in the presence of cyanamide at acid pH condenses to form dithymideine pyrophosphate and phosphodiester bonded compounds. Imidazole compounds and activated precursors such as nucleoside triphosphate are not necessary for this ologomerization reaction which produces primarily cyclic ologonucleotides.
The possibilities of the supporting effect of the fibula and of its preclusion are discussed. The indication of the fibulotomia is dealt with. According to the authors' standpoint in the case of the anatomical reposition of the tibial fracture and after its staple synthesis the supporting effect of the fibula is not be be feared. In these cases the reposition and the osteosynthesis of the fibula neutralize fairly well also the motive forces acting on the tibial fracture.
Barroom patrons consumed their drinks in significantly less time and with fewer sips than subjects observed in a laboratory. The former most often drank beer while the latter preferred mixed drinks.
Eight patients with drug intoxication were hemoperfused on ten occasions at a blood-flow rate of 300 ml/min with a 650gm column of Amberlite XAD-4 resin, which is a macroreticular resin with a specific adsorptive attraction for lipid-soluble organic molecules. Column clearances of glutethimide and a variety of barbiturates ranged from 207 to 300 ml/min for treatment sessions extending from 2 1/2 to ten hours. After ingestion of 75 gm of glutethimide, one patient received hemoperfusion on three successive days for nine, ten, and eight hours, respectively. She recovered after the column removed over 30 gm of drug. The patients demonstrated dramatic clinical responses with no evidence of meaningful toxic reactions. Column hemoperfusion with Amberlite XAD-4 resin was simpler and more effective than any known method of removing barbiturates and glutethimide from the blood of patients with drug overdoses.
Under general anaesthesia the common bile duct was ligated in two sheep and two calves. Occlusion of the duct was permanent and was followed by portal fibrosis, proliferation of bile ducts and intrahepatic bile stasis. Mild hepatic cell damage was accompanied by the release of glutamate dehydrogenase, sorbitol dehydrogenase and arginase into serum. The release of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase was slower but more continuous. One sheep and one calf developed peritonitis associated with the leakage of bile from a biopsy wound in the live. One of these animals and the other two on which biopsy was not performed became photosensitised on exposure to sunlight. The concentration of phylloerythrin was high in serum and urine. All animals became jaundiced and the increased concentration of bilirubin in serum and urine was mainly direct reacting, ie, conjugated with glucuronic acid.
The occurrence of acute dystonic reactions was studied relative to drug pharmacokinetic parameters following a single dose of the phenothiazine, butaperazine. Dystonias occurred more than one half-life from peak butaperazine levels, 23 to 56 h after drug administration. The authors postulate that the appearance of dystonias on falling plasma concentrations may be due to disruption of dopaminergic-cholinergic balance caused by differential antidopaminergic and anticholinergic potencies of the drug.
This paper presents the results of measurements of the acid-base and gaseous status of maternal and fetal capillary blood at the time of amniotomy, before the onset of labor. The correlation coefficient between maternal and fetal bicarbonate concentration is 0.6, and that between maternal and fetal PCO2 is 0.31. From the results obtained, as well as from a survey of other work in the field, it is proposed that the diffusion of carbon dioxide across the placenta could not explain some of the findings and that bicarbonate concentrations equilibrate across the placenta.
The electrophoretic mobility and adsorptive properties of kaolin and kaolin pretreated with anionic and cationic materials were examined over a range of pH values. Pretreatment with anionic compounds had little effect on mobility, while adsorption of cationic species markedly reduced mobility. These results are explained by reference to the structure of kaolin, and the interdependence of adsorption properties and electrophoretic mobility are discussed.
This paper reviews the history of understanding how biological systems can discriminate so strikingly among physically similar ions, especially alkali cations. Appreciation of qualitative regularities ("permitted sequences") and quantitative regularities ("selectivity isotherms") in ion selectivity grew first from studies of ion exchangers and glass electrodes, then of biological systems such as enzymes and cell membranes, and most recently of lipid bilayers doped with model pores and carriers. Discrimination of ions depends on both electrostatic and steric forces. "Black-box" studies on intact biological membranes have in some cases yielded molecular clues to the structure of the actual biological pores and carriers. Major current problems involve the extraction of these molecules; how to do it, what to do when it is achieved, and how (and if) it is relevant to the central problems of membrane function. Further advances are expected soon from studies of rate barriers within membranes, of voltage-dependent ("excitable") conducting channels, and of increasingly complex model systems and biological membranes.
1. Based on incorporation of radioactively labeled N-ethylmaleimide, the readily reactive thiol groups of isolated myosin (EC 3.6.1.3) from fast, slow and cardiac muscles could be classified into 3 types. All 3 myosins contain 2 thiol-1, 2 thiol-2 and a variable number of thiol-3 groups per molecule. Both thiol-1 and thiol-2 groups which are essential for functioning of the K+-stimulated ATPase, are located in the heavy chains in all 3 myosin types. 2. The variation in the incorporation pattern of N-ethylmaleimide over the 3 thiol group classes under steady-state conditions of Mg(2+) - ATP hydrolysis allowed different conformations of some reaction intermediates to be characterized. In all 3 types of myosin the hydrolytic cycle of Mg(2+) - ATP was found to be controlled by the same step at 25 degrees C. In all three cases, this rate-limiting step is changed in the same way by lowereing temperature. 3. Using the chemically determined molecular weights for myosin light chains, their stoichiometry was found on the basis of sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis to be 1.2 : 2.1 : 0.8 for light chain-1: light chain-2:light chain-3 per molecule of fast myosin, 2.0 : 1.9 for light chain-1:light chain-2 per molecule of slow myosin and 1.9 : 1.9 for light chain-1:light chain-2 per molecule of cardiac myosin. This qualitative difference in light subunit composition between the fast and the two types of slow myosin is not reflected in the small variations of the characteristics exhibited by the isolated myosins, but rather seems to be connected with their respective myofibrillar ATPase activities.
This paper reports a study of the importance of vasoactive amines in glomerular localization of passively administered immune complexes in the mouse. Two strains of mice were investigated, one sensitive and the other relatively resistant to the anaphylactogenic effect of intravenously administered immune complexes. The effect on glomerular deposition immune complexes in animals of both strains treated with either vasoactive amine depletors or antagonists leads to the conclusion that in this experimental system vasoactive amines do not play a major part in the glomerular localization of immune complexes.
In order to determine the possible role of the seminiferous tubules in the regulation of prolactin secretion during sexual development, male rats were rendered cryptorchid at 22 days of age, and thereafter different groups of animals were decapitated at 8-10 day intervals between Day 32 and Day 70. Cryptorchid rats showed destruction of the germinal epithelium accompanied by increased plasma FSH and, to a much lesser extent, increased plasma LH titers. Nevertheless, plasma prolactin levels were similar to those of intact controls throughout the entire period studied. Plasma prolactin titers in intact controls remained uniformly low from Day 20 to Day 70, contrasting with previous reports in which increasing prolactin levels have been observed during sexual development. To determine the reason for this apparent discrepancy, a longitudinal experiment was conducted in which intact and cryptorchid male rats were bled every 10 days from Day 30 to Day 70, following a 3-min period of exposure to ether fumes. The prolactin response to this stress increased markedly with age. A similar pattern of prolactin was observed in a cross-sectional study in which different groups of intact animals were bled following a 3-min period of ether exposure, at ages ranging from 20 to 70 daysmthe results indicate that unlike FSH secretion, prolactin secretion is not controlled by the seminiferous tubules. In addition, they suggest that the pattern of increasing plasma prolactin previously described in the developing male rat is at least in part caused by an age-dependent increase in responsiveness of prolactin to stress.
Mycobacterial growth inhibitory factor (MycoIF), found in supernatant fluids of mouse spleen cell cultures that have been stimulated in vitro with homologous  antigen, inhibited the intracellular multiplication of virulent tubercle bacilli within normal mouse peritoneal macrophages in vitro. Antigenically stimulated H37Ra-immunized mouse spleen cells required 72 h of incubation to produce supernatant fluids that would cause intracellular inhibition. Supernatant fluids from 48-h mouse spleen cell cultures were not able to produce intracellular inhibition. Investigation of the culture conditions showed that at lease 1.0% human serum was required in the tissue culture medium for the production of MycoIF by spleen cells from immunized mice. MycoIF activity was noted only in supernatant fluids from spleen cell cultures incubated with antigen for 72 h. MycoIF was nondialyzable and unaffected by freezing, lyophilization, or incubation at 60 C for 30 min. However, MycoIF was inactivated after incubation at 80 C for 30 min. MycoIF was unaffected by low hydrogen ion concentrations (pH 7 to 12), but exposure to higher hydrogen ion concentrations (pH 6, pH 5) significantly decrease MycoIF activity, and exposure to pH 4 to 2 abolished all activity. Supernatant fluids diluted 1:32 were still able to produce significant intracellular inhibition of growth of virulent tubercle bacilli.
Bacteriocins produced by six strains of Rhizobium trifolii were found to be of the relatively low molecular weight, non-phage type. The molecular weights ranged from approximately 1-8 X 105 to 2-0 X 105. All were of protein composition, as indicated by buoyant density (1-32 to 1-34 g/cm3) in CsC1 and by sensitivity to proteolytic enzymes. They were resistant to RNAase but sensitive to DNAase. The six bacteriocins could further be separated into two subgroups on the basis of sensitivity to extremes of pH, binding to filter membranes, activity spectrum on sensitive strains of R. trifolii, and possibly mode of action on sensitive bacteria. Bacteriocin production occurred spontaneously during the early-to mid-exponential phase of bacterial growth in broth culture.
The effects of the cardioselective beta-blocker, metoprolol, were evaluated under double-blind conditions in eighteen patients with angina pectoris. During an introductory run-in period of eight weeks, a placebo was given single-blindly. Thereafter two double-blind crossover periods each of four weeks followed, either 20 mg metroprolol or placebo being given t.i.d. Metoprolol gave a significant reduction in the number of anginal attacks and in nitroglycerin consumption. The patients' subjective assessments of their daily angina pectoris symptoms also showed a significant improvement compared with the placebo. At the end of each period, a standardized exercise test was performed. In comparison with placebo, metoprolol gave a significant increase of total work performed until the appearance of 1 mm ST-segment depression and until the end of exercise. The heart rate was significantly reduced at rest and during exercise. The blood pressure was significantly reduced only during exercise. None of the patients reported any severe unwanted effects. The complaints reported were mild to moderate, and the frequency during metoprolol treatment was even lower than during placebo treatment. No signs or symptoms of cardiac failure were seen in any of these patients on any occasion. It is concluded that 20 mg metoprolol t.i.d. is of benefit in the treatment of angina pectoris but further benefit might be obtained with higher doses.
Interaction of usual effectors with acetylcholinesterase (EC 3.1.1.7) from bovine erythrocytes was examined under conditions of high ionic strength (gamma/2 greater than or equal to 0,1). Detailed kinetic investigation of the hydrolysis of acetylcholine by acetylcholinesterase in the presence of modifiers shows that the effects produced by numerous quaternary nitrogen compounds on the enzyme can be explained on the basis of binding of the effectors to the anionic subsite of the active center. The various kinetic behaviors, that are observed, are dependent on the relative values of the deacetylation rate constant ak of the complex acetylated enzyme-modifier and of the rate constant k-2 defined by : (see article) with respect to the value of the deacetylation rate constant K of the acetylated enzyme. If a identical to [1--(k/k-2)]-1, it is shown that interaction of the enzyme with tetraethylammonium, pentamethonium, hexamethonium and gallamine ions is characterized by : a greater than a and k-2 greater than k therefore, these modifiers accelerate deacetylation. On the other hand, inhibition of acetylcholinestase by methylpyridinium, d-tubocurarine, tetra-n-propylammonium, tetra-n-butylammonium, decamethonium and succinylbischoline is consistent with one of the conditions : a less than a and k-2 greater than or equal to k or a greater than a and k-2 less than k and inhibition by tetramethylammonium, phenyltrimethylammonium, 3-hydroxyphenyl-triethylammonium, N-methylacridinium and bis (3-aminopyridinium)-1,10-decane ions agrees with one of the two previous conditions or with : (see article) consequently, the effect of these ligands on the deacetylation step is undetermined. However, the effects of choline chloride, thiazinamium methyl sulfate and thioridazine hydrochloride are not entirely consistent with this mechanism but support the existence of a functional peripheral anionic site which is distinct from the anionic subsite of the active center.
The administration of guanethidine to newborn rats has been shown to produce a permanent sympathectomy with potential advantages over immunosympathectomy and 6-hydroxydopamine-induced chemical sympathectomy. In this paper, we report on a revised treatment regimen involving initiation of treatment (50 mg/kg/day) on day 7 after birth and continuing for 3 weeks. Animals treated by this protocol have a low mortality rate (approx. 10% above saline-treated controls) and no permanent growth deficit. Analysis of tyrosine hydroxylase activity in and light microscopic examination of superior cervical ganglia of the guanethidine-treated animals indicate complete destruction of sympathetic neurons by the end of the second week of treatment. During and after treatment there are no decreases in norepinephrine in whole brain of the treated animals. Norepinephrine levels in peripheral tissues are markedly reduced at both 9 and 16 weeks of age. Stimulation of vasomotor outflow produces no increase in blood pressure in guanethidine-treated rats at 9 or 26 weeks of age, indicating a complete and permanent functional denervation of the vasculature. The adrenal glands of the guanethidine-treated animals are not destroyed, but rather respond, apparently by transsynaptic induction, with increases in tyrosine hydroxylase and epinephrine content. Interestingly, despite the continued deprivation of a peripheral sympathetic nervous system in these animals. adrenal tyrosine hydroxylase and epinephrine levels return to control levels by 10 weeks of age. These data indicate that administration of guanethidine to newborn rats produces a very complete and permanent sympathectomy with significant advantages over immunosympathectomy and 6-hydroxydopamine-induced chemical sympathectomy.
Experiments were conducted in anesthetized dogs comparing the effects of PGA1, PGE2, and diazoxide on myocardial contractile force (MC). The three agents were given in successive bolus injections intravenously in equidepressor doses and myocardial contractile force was measured by means of a strain-gauge arch sutured onto the right ventricle. The drugs were administered before and during ganglionic (hexamethonium) and beta-blockade (practolol). Both PGA1, and PGE2 caused a marked rise in MC, 24 and 20 per cent, respectively, before blockade and 10 and 11 per cent during blockade. Diazoxide caused only a minimal rise, 0.9 per cent, before blockade and a marked fall, 27 per cent, during blockade. Diazoxide administration during left ventricular bypass indicates that the decrease in MC is not a direct result of alterations in preload or after load. It is suggested that hypertensive patients treated with autonomic blocking agents may be more susceptible to heart failure in response to diazoxide therapy.
Above pH 8.5, pepsinogen is converted into a form which cannot be activated to pepsin on exposure to low pH. Intermediate exposure to neutral pH, however, returns the protein to a form which can be activated. Evidence is presented for a reversible, small conformational change in the molecule, distinct from the unfolding of the protein. At the same time, the molecule is converted to a form of limited solubility, which is precipitated at low pH, where activation is normally seen. The results are interpreted in terms of the peculiar structure of the pepsinogen molecule. Titration of the basic NH2-terminal region produced an open form, which can return to the native form at neutral pH, but which is maintained at low pH by neutralization of carboxylate groups in the pepsin portion.
Porcine and ovine 19-S thyroglobulins prepared from frozen glands in several buffers using slice extraction or homogenization, ammonium sulfate precipitation and DEAE-cellulose chromatography or Sepharose 6B gel filtration were contaminated with protease activity of pH optima 4.5 and 8.6, as shown by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Optimum temperatures of autodigestion were 37 degrees C at pH 4.5 and 25 degrees C at pH 8.6. Thyroglobulins prepared from unfrozen glands pH 7.2 in 0.1 M sodium phosphate using slice extraction, ammonium sulfate precipitation and Sepharose 6B gel filtration were devoid of acid proteolytic activity but still underwent autodigestion at pH 8.6. Diisopropylfluorophosphate was a potent inhibitor of the alkaline protease activity of ovine thyroglobulin preparations. In contrast to thyroglobulin obtained from frozen glands the proteins purified from fresh unfrozen glands at pH 7.2 only showed the 19-S and the 12-S species by electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels. Very few bands migrating faster than 12-S were visible. After full reduction and S-alkylation of porcine and ovine thyroglobulins, no qualitative changes were observed in the gel electrophoresis pattern as compared to the unmodified proteins. Species of apparent mol. wt. corresponding to the native 12 S were the major component, strongly suggesting a mol. wt. of about 330 000 for the elementary peptide chains of pig and sheep thyroglobulins.
An association between viral hepatitis and two rheumatic disease syndromes has been observed. Twenty-nine patients manifested a transient polyarthritis, sometimes associated with a rash (Group I). Ten patients were seen with a multisystem disease (Group II). Histologic evidence of arteritis or glomerulonephritis was present in seven of ten patients with multisystem disease. Liver tissue from 18 patients showed morphologic evidence of hepatitis with viral features in 9 of 10 patients in Group I and in 6 of 8 patients in Group II. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and/or antibody to HBsAg were detected in sera of all 39 patients. Abnormal liver functions were present in 36. Twelve Group I patients and 2 Group II patients became jaundiced. Rheumatoid factor was present in sera of seven patients in each group. The third component of complement (C3) was depressed in 13 patients in Group I and 7 patients in Group II. The fourth component of complement (C4) was decreased in 8 of 21 Group I and 3 of 7 Group II patients. Synovial fluid C3 was decreased in 2 of 11 Group I and 1 of 4 Group II patient's fluids. Articular inflammation in patients with transient polyarthritis responded in three to seven days to aspirin, acetominophen and/or bedrest alone and rashes disappeared spontaneously. Patients with multisystem disease generally had a prolonged illness and responded somewhat unpredictably to prednisone or a combination of prednisone and cyclophosphamide.
An intracellular L-asparaginase with antitumour activity was purified from a strain of Citrobacter. The optimum conditions for enzyme production by fermentation on scales up to 2700 l were investigated. Highest enzyme yield was obtained in corn-steep liquor medium (9-2%, W/V) at 37 degrees C. Oxygen limitation was not necessary for high enzyme yield. A total recovery of 4-3% from nucleic-acid-free extract and a 180-fold increase in specific activity were obtained after purificaiton. The specific activity of the purified preparation was 45 i.u./mg protein. The enzyme hydrolysed D-asparagine and L-glutamine at 7 and 5%, respectively, of its activity toward L-asparagine, but L-glutaminase activity could be demonstrated only at substrate concentrations above 5 mM. The Km values for L-asparagine and D-asparagine were 2-6 X 10(-5) and 1-4 X 10(-4) respectively. The anti-lymphoma activity of the enzyme was demonstrated with Gardner lymphosarcoma and was found only slightly less potent that Crasnitin, the most active asparaginase so far tested in this system.
Human liver contains three chromatographically distinct forms of non-specific acid phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.2). Acid phosphatases I, II and III have molecular weights of greater than 200 000, of 107 000, and of 13 400, respectively. Following partial purification, isoenzyme II was obtained as a single activity band, as assessed by activity staining with p-nitrophenyl phosphate and alpha-naphthyl phosphate on polyacrylamide gels run at several pH values. With 50mM p-nitrophenyl phosphate as a substrate, enzymes II and III exhibit plateaus of activity over the pH range 3 - 5 and 3.5 - 6, respectively. Acid phosphatase II is not significantly inhibited by 0.5% formaldehyde. The activity of human liver acid phosphatase II and of human prostatic acid phosphatase towards several substrates is compared. The liver enzyme, is marked contrast to the prostatic enzyme, does not hydrolyze O-phosphoryl choline.
Alumina gels were obtained from sodium aluminate by addition of 3 N HNO3, HCl or H2SO4 solutions or by saturation with gaseous CO2. The effect of several physicochemical factors (pH of precipitation, kind and concentration of precipitating agent, temperature) on the neutralizing properties of the obtained forms of Al(OH)3 was investigated. The linear correlation between the pH of precipitation and the neutralizing properties was found. The effect of different precipitating anions on the acid-consuming capacity and the rate of neutralization of 0-1 N HCl was established.
11 pregnancies at term were terminated by dilatation of the uterine cervix, low amniotomy, and by intravenous administration of PGF2alpha. The average infusion time was 3 hours 55 minutes, and the average total dose of PGF2alpha amounted to 2.0 mg. Parameters of acid-base changes, carbohydrate and energic state changes, gas metabolism, and changes in coagulation and fibrinolysis in mother and in fetus were analyzed during labor and after birth. Labor activity and fetal cardiac action were monitored cardiotocographically. Checked against 50 uncomplicated spontaneous deliveries, we found no disadvantageous changes in the parameters investigated.
To explore the possibility that the presence of propranolol-induced beta-adrenergic blockade might have an adverse effect upon homeostatic circulatory reflexes activated by the administration of a potent vasodilator agent, arterial blood pressure and pulse rate response to rapid intravenous diazoxide injection was monitored before and after pretreatment with propranolol in ten hypertensive patients. It appeared that beta-adrenergic blockade had no clinically significant effect on the magnitude of hypotension or the degree of heart rate acceleration induced by the administration of the potent vasodilator diazoxide. This reflex vasodilator-induced cardio-acceleration after propranolol adminstration could be the result of incomplete blockade of endogenously released neurotransmitter, inhibition of the parasympathetic nervous system, or a direct pharmacologic action of diazoxide. Diazoxide administration to hypertensive patients in the presence of beta-adrenergic blockade was not associated with any clinically significant hemodynamic consequences.
The interrelationship between the intestine microflora of lackey moth (Malacosoma neustria L.), brown-tail moth (Nygmia phaeorrhoea L.) and entomopathogenic bacteria Bacillus thuringiensis (Berl.), Bac. thuringiensis var. galleriea, and Bac. thuringiensis KR3 was studied in vitro. Various organisms of the intestine microflora of lackey moth display bacteriostatic action towards Bac. thuringiensis var. galleriea and Bac. thuringiensis KR3 which is not typical of the microflora of brown-tail moth that manifests mainly the batericidal action. Yeast cultures have been isolated from the intestines of lackey moth; the cultures stimulated growth of the studied entomopathogenic bacterial test cultures. Therefore, weak virulent action of Bac. thuringiensis towards brown-tail moth, as compared to its action on lackey moth, may be due to the bactericidal properties of some intestine microorganisms of brown-tail moth, and also the absence in their intestines of microorganisms stimulating growth of the entomopathogenic bacteria.
Data are presented which indicate that specially selected ART students can be trained to evaluate radiographs as to the presence or absence of significant pathology with an accuracy equivalent to that of experienced staff radiologists. The methods employed in this training program-namely, stressing perceptual recognition of normal and abnormal findings-may be beneficial in the early months of training of diagnostic radiology residents to hasten achievement of an acceptable perceptual performance. Test films, used in this study as an evaluation technique, may also be useful to assess residents' progress.
The slowly exchanging protons in oxidized and reduced horse heart cytochrome c (D20, uncorrected pH meter reading 6.5 room temperature) have been monitored by recording the 270 and 360 MHz proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of the reduced protein between 5 and 11 parts per million downfield from 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate.
Conditions are described in which the pneumococcal mutant strain sulr-c, resistant to the drug sulfanilamide, gives rise to sensitive segregants resistant to nitrobenzoic acid at a frequency constant with time. This segregant frequency is markedly enhanced upon exposure of the cells to doses of ultraviolet light or mitomycin C that permit survival of 50% to 90% of the cells. Treatment with acridine orange diminishes the segregant frequency. From the known influences of these three agents on genetic recombination, we propose that a recombination event is necessary in the generation of segregants.--During a period of incubation following treatment with ultraviolet light or mitomycin C, cell division resumes and the original segregant frequency is restored. Thus potential segregants are either unable to replicate in the absence of selection, or they are under-represented among the cells dividing soon after treatment.--If the sulr-c mutation is introduced into a mutant pneumococcal strain lacking an ATP-dependent exonuclease activity and deficient in recombination with transforming DNA, segregant frequencies are unaffected. This fact may indicate limits upon the type of recombination event responsible for segregation.
There is no single specific therapy for the treatment of middle ear effusions and, therefore, a holistic approach to management is necessary. Current management involves multiple therapeutic modalities of which we believe tube and allergy are most efficient.
Proceeding from a dynamic observation of the tolerance of physical exercises in the process of drug therapy of 90 patients with ischaemic heart disease the author concludes that a certain dissociation exists between the subjective effect of the antianginal drugs and the results of bicycle tests in the evaluation of the efficacy of the treatment. While a subjective improvement was declared in 2/3 of the patients, the exercise test indices improved only in 1/3. The bicylce test before and after the therapeutic course seems to facilitate a more precise evaluation of the efficacy of the antianginal drugs.
27 Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital. Artificial ventilation was given by a Starling pump respirator via a tracheal tube. Intracellular pH of cardiac muscle was determined by means of the indirect procedure of measuring the distribution of 5,5-dimethyl-2,4-oxazolidinedione (DMO) in intra- and extracellular spaces (DMO-method). 12 rats were injected i.p. with 0.33 mval potassium-magnesium-aspartate/100 g body weight and 15 rats served as controls. Using a regression analysis, the following relationships were obtained: 1. animals injected with potassium-magnesium-aspartate pHa = --0.75 log PaCO2 + 8.535, PHi = --0.30 log PaCO2 + 7.509, pHi = 0.41 pHa + 4.036; 2. control animals pHa = --0.59 log PaCO2 + 8.308, pHi = --0.27 log PaCO2 + 7.381, pHi = 0.47 pHa + 3.503. At a pCO2 of 40 torr a pHa of 7.33 (7.36) and a pHi of 7.03 (6.95) was obtained. At an arterial pH of 7.40 the pHi was 7.07 (6.98). The results of the control group are written in brackets. -- The experiments demonstrate an increase in the intracellular buffer bases after administration of potassium-magnesium-aspartate. This effect can be recognized by a concomitant increase in the intracellular pH of 0.09 compared to the control group.
This report extends earlier research, done with external media at pH 7.2, to new studies at pH 6.4 and 8.4 as well as 7.2, to determine the roles of the protonated and neutral forms of physostigmine (a weak base with pKalpha = 8.2) in causing twitch potentiation of the frog sartorius muscle. Physostigmine, especially at relatively high pH (8.4) and concentration (1.5 mM), considerably blocks excitation. However, the results show in general that physostigmine potentiation increased peak contraction time and thereby indicate that potentiation is occurring in terms of prolongation of the active state. At pH 6.4 and 8.4, 1 mM physostigmine causes no change in the mechanical threshold of K depolarization contractures of toe muscles, as found previously at pH 7.2. Physostigmine increasingly prolongs the action potential as pH rises, i.e., in positive correlation with the twitch potentiation, thus indicating that this electrical change is the prime determinant of the potentiation.
The consumption of complement observed during the induction of interferon by various inducers may proceed via the alternate pathway. The alternate pathway requires the presence of Mg ions in the medium while Ca ions may be absent.
Both phospholipases A1 and A2 activities (EC 3.1.1.4) at pH 7.4 were found to be significantly decreased in retinol-deficient rat testes supplemented with retinoic acid as compared to retinol-fed controls using 1-acyl-2-[1-(14)C]-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine as substrate. However, little or no difference was observed in phospholipase A1 activity at pH 3.0 in both groups of rats.
The present study demonstrates that exposure of cardiac muscle to high levels of glucose during anoxia appears to retard damage to myocardial protein synthesis. The mechanism of this "glucose" effect is glucose-specific and appears related to the intracellular metabolism of glucose by the anoxic myocardium.
Stationary-phase, minimal deviation hepatoma H4-II-E-C3 cell cultures that are serum-deprived respond with a biphasic time course of phenylalanine hydroxylase induction when dialyzed fetal calf serum or insulin is added. These two agents induce phenylalanine hydroxylase additively, during both the initial 3-hour and the delayed 24-hour phases. The initial phase of induction by insulin is inhibited by cycloheximide but not by actinomycin D. The delayed induction by both dialyzed fetal calf serum and insulin is inhibited by 10(-6) M cycloheximide and 0.20 mug/ml actinomycin D. H4-II-E-C3 cells in culture do not synthesize the factor(s) in serum that induce phenylalanine hydroxylase.
The effects of alcohol on human perceptual, cognitive and motor performance was assessed in a battery of tests, and the dose-response relationships for alcohol, important for the study of drug-alcohol interactions, established.
Dibenzepin and amitriptyline appeared to be equally efficacious in controlling target symptoms of depressive reactions. These results appear to be consistent with pharmacological profiles of the two drugs which are both tricylic compounds. Control of target symptoms occurred in an undulating and non-progressive manner in both groups. Aggravation of depressive symptomatology in the third week of treatment was noted in both groups and appeared to be clinically very important in the management of depressed patients. Dibenzepin caused relatively fewer side effects which appears to be an advantage over amitriptyline. Dibenzepin appeared to be a suitable alternative for amitriptyline intolerant patients, with moderately severe depression associated with anxiety, especially patients who demonstrated emotional sensitivity or passive dependent personality, and psychosomatic symptoms.
The values of Vmax and Km for the three genetic variants A, B, and A- of erythrocyte glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase have been determined at 10 different pH values in the range from 5.5 to 9.5, and at four different temperatures in the range from 18.5-40.0 degrees. The log Vmax versus pH curve for each of the enzymes shows a monotonic increase between pH 5.5 and 7, and a plateau from pH 7.5 upwards. These curves, and their temperature dependence, are compatible with the presence of a single ionizable group which, in its conjugate acid form, renders the enzyme-substrate complex inactive. The pK of this group is 6.94 at 18.5 degrees, and its enthalpy of ionization is 7.0 kcal mol-1. The log Km versus pH curves show a broad plateau between pH 6.2 and 8.2, interrupted by a sharp minimum at pH 7.2 for variant B, while variants A and A- show sharp maxima at pH 7.2 and 7.45, respectively. It is proposed that this unusual behavior depends on the dissociation of the tetrameric enzyme to dimers in this pH region. Specifically, it is shown that  a sharp maximum or minimum of Km can arise if cooperative uptake or release of protons is linked to dimer formation, and if the degree of cooperativity is different for the free enzyme compared to the enzyme-substrate complex. The pH dependence of the equilibrium between the tetrameric and the dimeric form of the enzyme has been determined by gel filtration for the same three genetic variants B, A, and A-. In agreement with previous ultracentrifugal data, the enzyme is a tetramer in acid solution and a dimer in alkaline solution. The pH at which half of the enzyme is in dimeric form, under our experimental conditions, is 7.15 +/- 0.05 for variants A and B, and 7.35 +/- 0.05 for variant A-. These pH values correspond closely, for all three variants, to the sharp extrema in the pH dependence of their Km values for glucose 6-phosphate. From the measured dissociation equilibria, it can be inferred that the tetramer-dimer transition entails cooperative release of protons. The degree of cooperativity estimated from these data agrees closely with the independent estimate based on the pH dependence of Km.
A study was carried out of 30 consecutive patients with withdrawal psychosis who in the period 1972 to 1975 were admitted to a psychiatric department or were attended by the department while hospitalized in a somatic department. There was a clear majority of women among cases of psychosis following drug withdrawal (15 as against four) and a clear majority of men among cases of psychosis following alcohol withdrawal (nine as against two). Competing pathogenetic factors could be considered present in most cases in the last mentioned group. In most cases the abrupt cessation took place in conjunction with admission to hospital, most frequently surgical cases or cases of acute drug toxication. In other cases abrupt cessation was decided upon by the patient himself. Frequently predelirium treatment was either omitted or was given in the form of neuroleptics. Approximately a quarter of the patients initially denied their abuse. The study indicates that withdrawal psychosis can make its debut or become manifest at so late a stage as about the 14th day of the withdrawal phase following use of benzodiazepines and d-propoxiphene. It is further indicated that abrupt cessation of benzodiazepines taken in "therapeutic" doses for several years in some instances can give rise to a withdrawal psychosis.
This work is concerned with the cleaning and disinfection by heat of stainless-steel and polypropylene bedpans, which had been soiled with either a biological contaminant, human serum albumin (HSA) labelled with technetium-99m 99m(Tc), or a bacteriological contaminant, streptococcus faecalis mixed with Tc-labelled HSA. Results of cleaning and disinfection achieved with a Test Machine and those achieved by procedures adopted in eight different wards of a general hospital are reported. Bedpan washers installed in wards were found to be less efficient than the Test Machine, at least partly because of inadequate maintenance. Stainless-steel and polypropylene bedpans gave essentially the same results.
The ultrastructural localization of NADH oxidase, a possible enzyme in the increased oxidative activity of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) during phagocytosis, was studied. A new cytochemical technique for the localization of H2O2, a product of NADH oxidase activity, was developed. Cerous ions, in the presence of peroxide, form an electron-dense precipitate. Resting and phagocytically stimulated PMN were exposed to cerous ions at pH 7.5 to demonstrate sites of NADH-dependent, cyanide-insensitive H2O2 production. Resting PMN exhibites slight activity on the plasma membrane; phagocytizing PMN had extensive deposits of reaction product localized within the phagosome and on the plasma membrane. Peroxide involvement was demonstrated by the inhibitory effect of catalase on cerium precipitation; the surface localization of the enzyme responsible was confirmed by using nonpenetrating inhibitors of enzymatic activity. A correlative study was performed with an NADH-dependent, tetrazolium-reduction system. As with cerium, formazan deposition on the surface of the cell was NADH dependent, cyanide insensitive, and stimulated by phagocytosis. Superoxide dismutase did not inhibit tetrazolium reduction, as observed cytochemically, indicating direct enzymatic dye reduction without superoxide interposition. These findings, combined with oxygen consumption studies on resting and stimulated PMN in the presence or absence of NADH, indicate that NADH oxidase is a surface enzyme in human PMN. It is internalized during phagocytosis and retains its peroxide-generating capacity within the phagocytic vacuole.
Copper (II) ions successively induce dimers and tetramers of human serum albumin (L) when the Cu (II) concentration is extended beyond that of 200 muM. This is shown by emf titrations and by ultracentrifugation experiments. The emf titrations, which involve a new pH static method, were performed at 25 degrees, in a 0.5 M NaCIO4 medium at pH 6.59, using glass and copper amalgam electrodes. The total concentration of Cu(II) varied from 0.14 to 2.2 mM and the albumin concentration from 0.05 to 0.7 mM. In order to evaluate the formula of the main complexes, without using any a priori assumptions regarding their compositions, a detailed graphic procedure was used. The results, in the form of equilibrium constants for the main species, were refined by the use of a general least squares computer program. The experimental data are found to be consistent with the formation of the monomeric CuL, Cu5L, and Cu6L species and the dimeric Cu3L2, Cu4L, Cu6L, and Cu8L2 species. In addition, there is some indication for a minor species, most probably the Cu12L4 tetramer. The pH static results qualitatively agree with the findings obtained by ultracentrifugation. As indicated by distinct bands and their S-values, ultracentrifugation experiments show not only monomeric and dimeric species of albumin, but also tetrameric species. The polymerization of the albumin is reversible, since diglycyl-L-histidine, a peptide designed to mimic the Cu (II) transport site of albumin, depolymerizes the Cu (II)-albumin polymers.
A double-blind study with intra-individual comparisons was carried out to investigate the effects of 15 mg of (8r)-3alpha-hydroxy-8-isopropyl-1alphaH-tropanium bromide(+/-)-tropate (Sch 1000), 15 mg Sch 1000 + 10 mg oxazepam, 10 mg oxazepam and placebo with oral administration in randomized sequence on gastric juice volume, amount of acid, concentration and pH values in 12 healthy volunteers. The secretion parameters were measured during a 1-h basal period and a 2-h stimulation period. The gastric juice was obtained in 15 min portions via stomach tube. Stimulation was effected by 1 mug/kg/h pentagastrin via drip infusion. The Friedman test was used for the comparative statistical evaluation, and individual comparisons were carried out by means of the Wilcoxon test (pair-differences rank). The results show that Sch 1000 and Sch 1000 + oxazepam were equal in effect on basal and stimulated secretion volume. As compared with placebo, it was not possible to establish an effect on secretion volume for oxazepam alone. Sch 1000 and Sch 1000 + oxazepam were found to be equipotent in reducing the amount of basal acid, while oxazepam reduced this quantity only during the first 30 min of basal secretion. None of the three active preparations was capable of inhibiting the stimulated acid, although both Sch 1000 preparations produced a clear trend towards lowered mean values. During the basal secretion period, all three test preparations had an inhibiting action on acid concentration, but none of them had a significant effect during the stimulation period. The pH value was savely increased only by Sch 1000 and Sch 1000 + oxazepam, and this even only during the basal period. The results are discussed.
It is proposed that the same diseases as those induced by the graft-versus-host reaction (GVHR) will arise in nonchimeric individuals, if structures of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on lymphocytes are altered, either by viral infection or by chemicals, in such a way that autologous T lymphocytes react against them as the react in the GVHR to semiallogeneic (F1) lymphocytes differing at the MHC. Diseases in which a GVHR-like pathogenesis is suspected will be discussed.
Ninety-nine percent 15N-enriched flavins were synthesized and their proton decoupled 15N resonances were observed. The enriched compounds were [1,3-15N]riboflavin, [1,3,5-15N]riboflavin, [1,3-15N]riboflavin 5'-phosphate, [1,3,5-15N]riboflavin 5'-phosphate, and [1,3,5-15N] flavin adenine dinucleotide, [1,3,5-15N] lumiflavin, and [1,3,5-15N] lumichrome. By comparison of their spectra and from th- nuclear Overhauser effect data each 15N resonance peak could be assigned to each 15N nucleus. The order of the chemical shifts well corresponds to that of the calculated pi-electron densities. The N-3 nucleus gives the most intense inverted peak and the N-5 nucleus a small noninverted peak. By changing pH from neutral to alkaline, the chemical shift and the intensity of signal were mostly affected in the N-3 resonance of riboflavin 5'-phosphate. The N-5 signal of flavin adenine dinucleotide showed a fairly large downfield shift with the increase of temperature. These observations can be well interpreted by the chemical structure and the proposed conformation of riboflavin 5'-phosphate and flavin adenine dinucleotide.
Two PZ-peptidases (EC 3.4.-) (A and B) cleaving a synthetic substrate for collagenase, 4-phenylazobenzyloxycarbonyl-L-Pro-L-Leu-Gly-L-Pro-D-Arg (PZ-peptide) have been separated from the particulate fraction of bovine dental follicle. PZ-peptidase A had a molecular weight of 220 000, an optimum pH at 8.0-8.5, and a Km value of 67 muM toward PZ-peptide at pH 7.1, whereas PZ-peptidase B had a molecular weight of 20 000, an optimum pH at 6.5-6.7, and a Km value of 400 muM toward PZ-peptide at pH 7.1. Two similar enzymes were also isolated from the soluble fraction. Since the pH-activity curve of the crude tissue preparations such as homogenate, microsomes and soluble supernatant had two peaks at 6.5-6.7 and 8.0-8.5, both PZ-peptidase A and B may exist in situ as two independent active enzymes.
Regional distributions of PGE 9-ketoreductase and 15-hydroxy-prostaglandin dehydrogenase were examined in the cytoplasmic fractions from the kidneys of seven species. All species contained an NADPH-dependent reductase, as well as NAD+- and NADP+-dependent dehydrogenases in both cortex and medulla. A previously unrecognized cytoplasmic NADH-dependent PGE 9-ketoreductase was also detected in the cortex and medulla of rat and bovine kidney. Total NAD+- and NADP+-dependent dehydrogenase activity was about equally distributed between the two renal regions of monkey, dog, rat, and swine. Bovine, rabbit, and cat had greater cortical than medullary dehydrogenase activity with ratios of 3, 5, and 10 respectively. The activities of NAD+- and NADP+-dependent dehydrogenase varied among the renal tissues.
The first committed step of aromatic amino acid biosynthesis in Salmonella typhimurium was shown to be catalyzed by three isoenzymes of 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonic acid 7-phosphate (DAHP) synthase. Mutations in each of the genes specifying the isoenzymes were isolated and mapped. aroG, the structural gene for the phenylalanine-inhibitable isoenzyme, was linked to gal, and aroH, the structural gene for the tryptophan-inhibitable isoenzyme, was linked to aroE. aroF, the structural gene for the tyrosine-inhibitable isoenzyme, was linked to pheA and tyrA, which specify the phenylalanine- and tyrosine-specific branch-point enzymes, respectively. The phenylalanine-inhibitable isoenzyme was the predominant DAHP synthase in wild-type cells, and only the tryosine-inhibitable isoenzyme was completely repressed, as well as inhibited, by low levels of its allosteric effector. The DAHP synthase isoenzymes were separated by chromatography on diethylaminoethyl-cellulose with a phosphate gradient which contained enolpyruvate phosphate to protect the otherwise unstable phenylalanine-inhibitable isoenzyme. No cross-inhibition of either the tyrosine- or phenylalanine-inhibitable isoenzyme was observed at inhibitor concentrations up to 1 mM. The tryptophan-inhibitable isoenzyme was partially purified from extracts of a strain lacking the other two isoenzymes and shown to be inhibited about 30% by 1 mM tryptophan. A preliminary study of interference by tryptophan in the periodate-thiobarbiturate assay for DAHP suggested a combined effect of tryptophan and erythrose 4-phosphate, or an aldehydic compound resulting from degradation of erythrose 4-phosphate by periodate.
Copper, as a component of numerous cuproenzymes, plays a vital role in many physiologic functions in man and animals. From the stand-point of human health there are at least three functional areas of prime importance. Copper is involved in the development and maintenance of cardiovascular and skeletal integrity, central nervous system structure and function, and erythropoietic function including iron metabolism. Although there is no evidence for widespread copper deficiency in the human population, it does occur, owing to genetic defects and other precipitating factors. A clear understanding of the functions of copper and its mechanisms of action could prove highly beneficial in the solution of present and unforeseen problems in medicine.
The purpose of this work was in investigate the capability of cell extracts of Escherichia coli and E. coli treated with colicin K to catalyze the following energy-dependent reverse transhydrogenase reaction: NADP + NADH + ATP in equilibrium NADPH + NAD +ADP + Pi. Under anaerobic conditions this reaction requires the presence of a specific portion of the electron transport chain, a functional energy coupling system, including an adenosine triphosphatase, enzyme, and ATP as energy source. The ATP-linked reaction was partially inhibited in French press extracts of E. coli K-12 C600 cells that had been pretreated with colicin K but not in extracts from similarly treated cells of a colicin-tolerant mutant. Ultracentrifugation of extracts yielded particulate fractions competent in catalyzing the reaction; this reaction is substantially inhibited in fractions from colicin-treated cells. The extent of inhibition increased with increasing concentration of colicin. Supernatants also supported ATP-linked formation of NADPH, but this reaction was insensitive to the colicin effect. A comparison between the requirement of the reaction in supernatant and particulate fractions suggests that the reaction in the supernatant is different from the one inhibited by colicin. The ATP-hydrolyzing ability of particulate fractions from the control or treated bacteria was identical. Likewise, the electron transport chain was not affected by colicin treatment, as evidenced from lack of effect on NADH oxidase, succinic dehydrogenase, and NADPH-NAD transhydrogenase. It is concluded that colicin K interferes with the coupling of ATP the utilization of the intermediate for the ATP-linked transdehydrogenase reaction.
Interaction of cytidine 5'-phosphate with chloroacetone or p-tosyloxyacetone leads to 2-methyl-5,6-dihydro-5-oxo-6-(5-0-phospho-beta-D-ribofuranosyl)-imidazo/1,2-c/pyrimidine (2-methylethenocytidine 5'-phosphate) whereas analogous reaction with phenacyl bromide produces similar 2-phenyl-derivative. The bicyclic nucleotides obtained showed significant UV absorption at long wavelength where common nucleotides and proteins exhibited no absorption. These derivatives are highly fluorescent when heterocyclic ring is protonated. The absorption and fluorescent properties of the substituted ethenocytidine 5'-phosphoate derivatives seem to be suitable for their use as fluorescent probes or labels in biochemical studies.
The endogenous RNApolymerase activity of isolated cell nuclei and chloroplasts from young pea plants (Pisum sativum) has been studied. The presence of all four nucleoside triphosphates and Mg2+ ions is necessary for the reaction. The missing of one of these nucleotides from the reaction mixture, especially ATP, sharply decreases the transcription. Chloroplasts synthesize RNA per DNA unit more intensively, than nuclei. In spring such predominance is especially pronounced. Maximal synthesis of RNA is observed at pH 8.3 both in nuclei and chloroplasts. Maximal transcription was observed at 25 degrees in chloroplasts and at 30--35 degrees in nuclei. Actinomycin D inhibited the process of transcription both in nuclei and some stimulation in chloroplasts were observed, when rifamicin B was added. It is suggested that there are differences in nuclear and chloroplast forms of RNA polymerase.
Each of 21 dogs was bled until mean arterial blood pressure fell to 50 torr; this hemorrhagic shock state was then maintained for two hours. During hemorrhagic shock, the blood lactate concentration increased sixfold. The severe metabolic acidosis in arterial blood was partially compensated by a decreased PCO2 caused by increased ventilation. However, in mixed venous blood, the metabolic acidosis was combined with a respiratory acidosis. This hypercapnia in venous blood was indicative of the increased PCO2 in tissues poorly perfused following hemorrhage. The increase in the PCO2 of the femoral venous blood was greater than that in mixed venous blood, suggesting that some tissue beds were better perfused than those of the hind limb during shock. The intracellular lactate concentration of hind limb skeletal muscle was greatly increased in the shock state, and tissue PCO2 rose. Intracellular pH of skeletal muscle was only slightly decreased and bicarbonate concentration was unchanged during this combined metabolic and respiratory acidosis. This capacity of skeletal muscle to maintain a high HCO-3 concentration in intracellular fluid during metabolic acidosis may be an enhanced response of the mechanism responsible for maintaining (HCO-3)i normally at a level approximately ten times that which would be expected if HCO-3 were distributed passively.
During two epidemics of influenza A infection in Stockholm 1969-72, 249 cases were selected for a study on the effect of bacterial superinfection. Bacterial involvement was demonstrated through cultures and serologic reactions. The occurrence of C-reactive protein in increased amount in serum was significantly more common in the group which had the strongest indication of bacterial infection. An increased duration of fever, and a higher incidence of pneumonia, leukocytosis and erythrocyte sedimentation rate over 50 mm/l h was also the rule in cases with bacterial involvement. During both epidemics the bacteria most often involved were pneumococci.
A method of measuring gastric secretions and emptying rates after ingestion of an ordinary (solid-liquid) meal has been developed and validated. The technique quantifies movements of volume across the pylorus using constant duodenal perfusion with a nonabsorbable marker, polyethylene glycol (PEG), which, in turn, quantifies emptying into the duodenum of another marker, [14C]PEG, incorporated in the meal. Acid and pepsin outputs can be determined without manipulation of the intragastric pH. Employing this method, we have simultaneously quantified acid, pepsin, and total secretory outputs; rates of gastric emptying of meal and secretions; and serum gastrin levels during digestion. These data characterize physiological responses to ordinary food in health.
From a pair of parietal electrodes, an original apparatus--the monitor of cerebral function--gives a non-stop recording of the brain electric activity for frequencies ranging from 2 to 15 Hertz. It is at the moment less expensive than an ordinary EEG apparatus, easy to carry, to use and to read. The artefacts, interferences or technical defects are either totally eliminated or immediately detected thanks to a parallel graph. It is the first apparatus that has been conceived and used as a routine instrument for cerebral monitoring. It can be used in the Intensive Care Unit as well as in the Operating Theatre:--preventively, whenever there is a risk of an alteration in the cerebral circulation (CEC - extracorporal circulation - for instance - as a diagnosis, a prognosis or a therapy when there is a cerebral lesion (whatever the origin of it can be). The use of this apparatus (that has now become part of the daily routine at the London Hospital) has quickly proved indispensable and the common EEG is no longer being resorted to except upon very few occasions.
The biochemical properties of the electrically excitable sodium channels in the electroplaque of Electrophorus electricus were investigated using tritiated tetrodotoxin (TTX) as a specific membrane probe. Membrane fragments from the electroplaque were isolated essentially by differential centrifugation and characterized with respect to the plasma membrane markers acetylcholine receptors, acetylcholinesterase, (Na+ + K+)ATPase, and [3H]TTX binding. Equilibrium binding studies showed that [3H]TTX bound to a single population of noninteracting receptor sites with an apparent dissociation constant of 6 +/- 1 X 10(-9) M. The toxin-membrane complex dissociated with a first-order rate constant of 0.012 sec-1. Studies on the pH dependence of complex formation demonstrated the requirement for an ionizable, functional group with a pK of 5.3 and this group has been shown to be a carboxyl. Treatment of the membranes with trimethyloxonium tetrafluoroborate, a carboxyl group modifying reagent, resulted in an irreversible loss in the binding of [3H]TTX, which could be prevented by low concentrations of TTX or saxitoxin. This decrease was due to a reduction in the total number of binding sites and not to a decrease in toxin binding affinities. The relative binding affinities of various monovalent alkali metal and polyatomic cations for the TTX-receptor site showed that this site displayed cation discrimination properties which were similar to those reported previously for the electrically excitable sodium channel in intact nerve fibers. A possible role for this site in the ion selectivity of the sodium channel is proposed.
SU-23397 is a unique new hybrid molecule, the animal profile being characteristic of neuroleptic activity. Although the trial was uncontrolled, there appears to be no doubt that SU-23397 exerts antipsychotic activity between 20 mg and 250 mg daily in severely ill schizophrenic patients. Seven of the ten subjects required at least transient antiparkinson medication. Two patients demonstrated premature ventricular contractions. One patient had infrequent PVCs at baseline which increased in frequency with rising dosage. The other patient developed frequent premature ventricular contractions only after active and medication was initiated and was subsequently withdrawn from the study.
(1) Changes of the holding potential applied to the membrane of myelinated nerve fibres induced slow variations of the peak sodium current, which are super-imposed on the effect of sodium inactivation. (2) These slow variations are transitions between various steady levels of available sodium conductance. Their time course can be described by the function erfc (square root t/tau) where tau is the time and erfc the error function complement. The characteristic time tau lies in the range 2-4 min and depends on the membrane potential. (3) Changes of extracellular pH cause a rapid change of the peak sodium current followed by a slow variation as observed after changes of the holding potential. This slow variation can be prevented by applying simultaneously an appropriate change of the holding potential, e.g. the effect of changing pH from 7.3 to 5.3 is balanced by changing the potential from --70 to --55 mV. (4) The results are interpreted by postulating charged components diffusion slowly within the nodal membrane. Their transverse distribution controls the number of sodium channels available at a given membrane potential. The equivalence between change of pH and voltage is explained by assuming negative fixed charges at the outer surface of the membrane, which are protonated at low pH and thus affect the intrinsic membrane potential. (5) It is concluded that effects which are ascribed to the action of agents on individual sodium channels have to be corrected for variations in the number of available channels if these agents influence the intrinsic membrane potential, e.g. changes of extracellular pH.
In summary, 40 p. 100 of 104 reinterventions carried out in 71 patients from the Resuscitation sector were decided upon in the absence of surgical and nephrological criteria. The authors emphasize the value of the infectious syndrome (74 p. 100 of the cases), of water and electrolyte disorders (60 p. 100 of the cases), and of hypercatabolism (83 p. 100 of the cases).
Although cerebral angiography should be approached with caution in the diagnosis of inflammatory cerebro-vascular disease there are some characteristic angiographic findings which may be helpful for classification and differential diagnosis. The proximal cerebral arteries are favourably affected by basal meningitis and thrombangiitis obliterans with resulting stenoses and occlusions. Whereas those inflammations originating from neighbouring skull structures mostly involve the intracavernous parts of the carotid artery, the tuberculous and mycotic arteritis prefer the supraclinoid carotid siphon. Peripheral vascular changes are found in luetic endangiitis, necrotizing and toxic angiitis and in collagenoses. Simultaneous involvement of the temporal arteries is of great diagnostic importance demonstrating the systemic character of the inflammatory process; in Horton's arteritis it can be a pathognomonic finding. Infectious endocarditis, some mycoses and malaria may lead to embolic occlusion of cerebral vessels. Mycotic aneurysms mostly have a broad base or a fusiform shape and do not prefer the localizations of congenital aneurysms. Angiographically, abscesses, tuberculomas and viral encephalitis may result in circumscribed hypervascularized areas. The characteristic angiographic findings are exemplified and discussed on the basis of 8 cases of inflammatory cerebro-vascular disease (tuberculosis, pneumococcal and unspecific bacterial meningitis, syphilis, mycosis, Takayasu-syndrome, panarteritis nodosa, temporal arteritis).
The introduction of measuring the pH appears to place it in competition with Apgar scoring because of its precision. A study of this which has been carried out has illustrated that there are two different criteria for assessing the state of the infant at birth. The usual agreement between pH values and Apgar scoring can be broken when clinical fetal distress has become established before metabolic equilibrium of the infant has become modified. In these circumstances the Apgar score will be bad while the pH will be good.
In an infertile man and his only, likewise infertile, brother the sperm contained only round-headed spermatozoa. Electron microscopic examination of embedded ejaculate revealed a malformation, viz. absence of acrosomes in all the spermatozoa with consequent lack of normal development of the heads of the spermatozoa. Acrosomeless spermatozoa were also found in the testicular tubuli. No disturbance of the endocrine functions could be demonstrated. The blood cells were of normal male karyotype. Investigation of meiosis, on the other hand, showed rudimentary second division. Two other unrelated infertile men showed the same isolated disturbance in their spermiogram. Treatment with chlomiphene had no effect on the structure of the spermatozoa or on the infertility. The rare disorder, which seems to be a special syndrome, the first hitherto distinguishable among the various types of teratospermia, and its probable background are discussed.
There is a description of the determination of the enzymatic activity of acid proteinases: the method is based on the use of 125J-labelled natural protein substrates. Labelled albumin 125J, globulin 125J, and insulin 125J were tested for the determination of activities. All the substrates were hydrolyzed with the enzymes of the supernatant fraction (106 000 g) of beff liver homogenate in the zone of acid pH. Optimum comditions of enzymatic reaction were tested, the dependence of reaction on the concentration of the enzyme, on time, and on temperature was determined, pH optimum was ascertained for individual substrates, and pH stability was determined. It follows from the results that the method is suitable for the determination of the enzymatic activity of proteinases of the cathepsin character.
Conformational states of fibrinogen and fibrin monomer were studied by methods of differential and solvent-perturbation spectrophotometry and ultraviolet fluorescence at about neutral pH (6.5) and in the region of lower pH, 3.2 to 4.0. To prevent repolymerization of fibrin monomer at pH 6.5, urea was added in a non-denaturing concentration of 1.7 M. In the acid region specified, the immediate environment of tyrosine and tryptophan residues was found to be more polar and the accessibility to perturbants higher than at pH 6.5. Much more drastic changes of the same type occurred at pH less than 3 when denaturation of the protein takes place. The conformation of fibrinogen altered progressively upon lowering pH from 4.0 to 3.2. This acidity increase, practically, did not influence the conformation of fibrin monomer. Thus the tolerance of the latter to the appearance of the new positively changed groups seems to be comparably high. The bulk of the conformational changes subsequent upon neutralization of an acid fibrin monomer solution proceeds at a higher rate than the activation transition, i.e. the acquirement of a state of polymerization readiness by fibrin monomer molecules.
1. The isolated perfused kidneys of fed rats in normal acid-base status showed a constant rate of lactate removal from the perfusate between 5 and 90 min of perfusion at a perfusate pH of 7-4-7-5. 2. Lactate removal by kidneys of rats in normal acid-base status was stimulated within 30 min by a reduction in perfusate pH to 7-1-7-2, but depressed when perfusate pH was reduced further. 3. Kidneys taken from rats previously made acidotic and perfused with media of various pH values showed a progressive fall in the rate of lactate removal during the perfusion. 4. Glucose output by the kidneys of rats in normal acid-base status perfused with lactate as substrate was not affected by an alteration in perfusate pH. The kidneys of acidotic rats generally showed an increased rate of glucose output compared with those of control rats.
1. Electrical activity has been recorded from Stomphia coccinea during the behavioural sequence in which the detached anemone settles on to a Modiolus shell. 2. When a responsive tentacle contacts the shell, a short, complex burst of pulses is elicited. These remain confined to the region of contact. The endodermal slow-conduction system (SS2) then begins to fire repetitively (a typical example is 16 SS2 pulses at a mean interpulse interval of 5 s) until the pedal disc begins to inflate. Shell-tentacle contact is essential for stimulation of SS2 activity. 3. The complete response, apart from local bending of the column, may be reproduced by electrical stimulation of the SS2 alone. As few as 10 stimuli at frequencies between 1 shock/s and 1 shock/10 s are required to elicit the response.
Human red blood cells (HRBC) even without prior neuraminidase treatment, could form rosettes with human peripheral blood lymphocytes in vitro. The optimum conditions for forming these rosettes were a pH of 7-0 and a medium with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Rosette proportions became much less at a different pH or using lower concentrations of BSA, or replacing BSA with foetal calf sera (FCS) or human sera. Rosette formation was also promoted by prior treatment of HRBC or lymphocytes with neuraminidase. Mixed rosettes of HRBC and sheep red blood cells (SRBC) showed that HRBC receptors were detectable only on lymphocytes that possessed SRBC receptors, suggesting that HRBC rosette-forming cells were probably thymus-derived (T) cells. Next, the properties of human red blood cell (HRBC) and sheep red blood cell (SRBC) rosette-forming cells were investigated by comparing the ability of human peripheral blood lymphocytes to form these two types of rosettes after treatment with various inhibitory reagents. HRBC rosettes were relatively more resistant to inhibition with: (1) proteolytic agents, such as trypsin, alpha-chymotrypsin and pronase; (2) anti-thymocyte serum (ATS); (3) metabolic inhibitors, such as sodium azide and 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP); (4) cytochalasin B. On further incubation after trypsinization, the lymphocytes recovered some ability to form SRBC rosettes, but continued to lose more of their capability to form HRBC rosettes. All these results were regarded as circumstantial evidence that the HRBC rosettes might represent a subpopulation of human T lymphocytes.
The secretion of vasoactive amines from rabbit platelets induced by the platelet-activating factor (PAF) derived from IgE-sensitized rabbit basophils, was examined. The secretion required calcium has previously been shown to be noncytotoxic and was optimal in both rate and extent at 37 degrees C and pH 7.2. Different temperature-sensitive steps were rate limiting for secretion above or below 20 degrees C. The rate of secretion was dependent upon the concentration of PAF and also of platelets. Maximal rates were observed with relatively low concentrations of platelets (2.5 X 10(8)/ml), sharply contrasting with other platelet stimuli such as C3 or thrombin. The extent of secretion was dependent upon PAF concentration until a maximum of 50 or 60% of the serotonin was released and then declined with increasing amounts of PAF. This was interpreted to result from the platelets becoming desensitized to the PAF, a process that shuts off the secretion. Such a desensitization was demonstrated and was shown to be stimulus specific, i.e., other stimuli could still induce secretion from PAF-desensitized platelets. PAF extracted with ethanol from the albumin to which it is usually bound during preparation, exhibited similar characteristics, except that secretion of up to 90% of the serotonin was induced. The extracted PAF thus seemed less able to induce the desensitization. Its use did provide important evidence that populations of rabbit platelets are relatively homogenous in their ability to respond to PAF.
The effects of some drugs on the beating frequency of isolated cells of the chick amnion cultivated on cover slips were investigated. Cholinergic and adrenergic agonists and antagonists, serotonine, antispasmodics, coronary dilatants and local anesthetics influenced the beating frequency significantly. The isolated chick amnion cells equal in their pharmacological behaviour the intact chick amnion and smooth muscle cells of mammals but differ from isolated beating heart cells.
1) Acidic forms of the sulphatase were partially purified from the following invertebrate species: Tethya aurantium (Porifera), Patella vulgata (mollusca), Maja squinado (Arthropoda), Marthasterias glacialis (Echinodermata) and Microcosmus sulcatus (Tunicata). Enzyme preparations thus obtained cleaved cerebroside sulphates (sulphatides) only in the presence of either specific detergents (e.g. taurodeoxycholate) or an activator protein isolated from human liver. This corresponds to the findings on purified sulphatase A of human origin. 2) At low concentrations, the activating effect was proportional to the amount of activator protein applied; at higher concentrations, proportionality was obtained only in some cases. On a molar basis, less of the activator protein was required to achieve the same activation as taurodeoxycholate. At optimum concentrations of the detergent however, the activation was much higher. 3) The enzyme specificity of the activator and some evolutionary implications are discussed.
In rat lung slices 3H-disodium cromoglycate (3H-DSCG) (0.001 mM) was taken up rapidly and 3H-DSCG tissue spaces, which equilibrated by 30 minutes, remained constant over a 4-hour incubation period. In contrast, 35S-phenol red (0.001 mM) accumulated in lung slices to a much greater extent than did DSCG, and the measured tissue spaces continued to increase over a 3-hour incubation period. In the presence of either phenol red (1 mM) or the metabolic inhibitors, iodoacetic acid (10(-4) M) and dinitrophenol (10(-4) M), 3H-DSCG uptake was significantly decreased. Accumulation of 3H-DSCG in lung slices and binding to tissue homogenates (pH 7.4) was also decreased when Ca and Mg ions were omitted from the bathing solution. Although DSCG and phenol red mutually inhibited the accumulation of one another over time in lung slices and 3H-DSCG (0.001 mM) binding to lung homogenates was decreased in the presence of 1 mM phenol red, 35S-phenol red efflux was not altered by the addition of 1 mM DSCG during the washout. Thus, it appears that, in rat lung, DSCG and phenol red share a common binding site(s) for uptake, possible on the transport "carrier." Also, there appear to be additional pulmonary binding sites for phenol red. These sites are not occupied by DSCG and their presence could account for the differences observed in the extent of accumulation of the two compounds in lung slices.
Microwave irradiation of 6 kw at 2450 MHz for 300 msec was sufficient to completely inactivate mouse brain cholinesterase and choline acetyltransferase. After this method of sacrifice, the acetylcholine contents of mouse brain regions, given in nanomoles per gram, were found to be: striatum, 81; medulla-pons, 44; diencephalon-midbrain, 34; hippocampus, 31; cerebral cortex, 26; and cerebellum, 17. Sodium pentobarbital caused a dose-dependent increase in whole brain acetylcholine. A maximal increase of 81% in whole brain was seen at 15 minutes with 80 mg/kg of sodium pentobarbital. The increase in acetylcholine after sodium pentobarbital treatment was not caused by anoxia from respiratory depression or by hypothermia. All brain regions except the cerebellum exhibited an increase in acetylcholine after pentobarbital treatment. Fifteen minutes after treatment, cerebellar acetylcholine was significantly decreased. However, at the time when half of the animals had regained the righting reflex, the unconscious mice showed an increase in cerebellar acetylcholine which was statistically significant  as compared to control. The relative accumulation rate of acetylcholine calculated for cerebral cortex and hippocampus was higher than that for striatum although the absolute rate of accumulation of ACh was higher in the striatum. Thus, after sodium pentobarbital treatment, the cerebral cortex and hippocampus exhibit a greater cholinergic response than the striatum.
The normal levels of ribonuclease activity in the serum of children of both sexes of various ages. The children into four age groups: thee 1st grous--from 1 to 7 days of age, the 2nd--from 1 to 12 months, 3rd--from 1 to 3 years, 4th--from 7 to 14 years of age. The ribonuclease activity amounted, in the various age groups, respectively tto: 1st group--0.27+0.07 ug/ml of serum, 2nd--0.21+0.06 ug/ml, 3rd--0.15+0.04 ug/ml, 4th--0.14+0.04 ug/ml.
An immunosuppressive factor was purified from Ehrlich carcinoma ascites by the combination of ultrafiltration and Sephadex chromatography. The resulting product showed 50% reduction in the number of splenic plaque-forming cells in mice immunized with sheep red blood cells when as low as 50 mug dose was given twice intraperitoneally before erythrocyte injection. The molecular size of the product was between 30,000 and 100,000, and it was relatively heat unstable.
Several neurally active amino acids were injected into the third ventricle of anesthetized male rats. Two or eight mumole of GABA produced significant increases in the plasma concentrations of prolactin (PRL), indicating increased PRL release from the pituitary. Two mumole of glycine was also effective in elevating PRL levels. The intraventricular injection of the lowest dose of GABA (1.0 mumole), glutamate (0.4 or 2.3 mumole), lysine (0.2 or 2.0 mumole), or 0.9% NaCl did not alter PRL levels significantly. Plasma PRL concentrations did not increase following the injection of GABA or glycine directly into the anterior pituitary gland. The results suggest that GABA and glycine may play a role in the neural regulation of PRL secretion.
In anesthetized dogs given secretin intravenously in doses doubling every 60 min and ranging from 0.5 to 8 units per kg body weight per hr, cyclic-AMP levels in pancreatic tissue rose continuously, whereas DNA concentrations were slightly decreased. Bicarbonate concentrations and bicarbonate outputs, cyclic-AMP tissue concentrations and bicarbonate outputs, as well as cyclic-AMP tissue concentrations and juice outputs, were significantly correlated. In conscious pancreatic fistula dogs, there was also a significant correlation between cyclic-AMP and bicarbonate concentrations and outputs in the pancreatic juice after stimulation by exogenous secretin. Accordingly, enhanced release of endogenous secretin achieved by intraduodenal acidification led to a dose-dependent increase in bicarbonate and cyclic-AMP outputs in both conscious and anesthetized dogs. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors (aminophylline, caffeine, and papaverine) given alone to the conscious dogs did not initiate pancreatic bicarbonate secretion, but they potentiated bicarbonate responses to exogenous secretin. These data suggest that cyclic-AMP plays a part in secretin-stimulated pancreatic secretion.
A white North American girl with clinical features of the mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome had a myocardial infarct and angiographic evidence of a coronary artery aneurysm and mitral regurgitation. The mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome has been extensively diagnosed in Japan in recent years. It appears to be a distinct entity, although not precisely separated from polyarteritis nodosa in childhood. The condition may be more common than previously realized.
Mortality and cerebral glycolytic metabolism were studied after bilateral ligation of the common carotid artery in normotensive Wistar rats (NTR), and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) derived from Wistar strain. In the first 24 hours after occlusion of carotid arteries, 72 per cent of 108 SHR died, whereas it was fatal in only 16 per cent of 43 NTR. In SHR, cerebral lactate and cerebral lactate/pyruvate ratio (L/P ratio) increased by 12.4 and 12.1 times the control, respectively at five to six hours after ligation, and remained raised even in rats surviving for two to three days thereafter. Changes in cerebral lactate and L/P ratio were minimal in NTR. Cerebral ATP decreased markedly at five to six hours after ligation in SHR studied. These results indicate that bilateral carotid artery ligation causes severe brain damage in SHR but not in NTR, suggesting hypertension per se to be operative for the development of cerebral ischaemia.
A highly selective and sensitive spectrophotometric determination of cobalt (II) was developed. 7-Nitroso-8-hydroxyquinoline-5-sulfonic acid sodium salt was used as the chromogenic reagent for color development. Although other metals form colored chelates with the ligand, it was possible to develop a selective method using McIlvaine's pH 8 citric acid-phosphate buffer. Under these conditions, iron(II), iron (III), copper (II), zinc (II), and manganese (II), minerals likely to be compounded with cobalt (II) in geriatric formulations, do not interfere with the precision of the method or the color development. Calcium (II) and magnesium (II) do not form colored chelates with the used ligand. Hormones, vitamins, and additives likely to be present along with the cobalt ion in pharmaceutical formulations do not interfere. The sensitivity is 0.37 mug of cobalt (II)/ml of sample solution.
An endogalactosaminidase has been purified 34-fold from the culture filtrate of Streptomyces griseus. This enzyme cleaves GalN-GalN linkages in oligogalactosaminoglycan, a galactosamine-rich oligosaccharide isolated from the culture filtrate of a Neurospora mutant. Since some or all of the GalN-GalN bonds in this molecule link positions 1 and 4, and are in the alpha-configuration, we are probably dealing with an endo-alpha-(1 leads to 4)-galactosaminidase, bu this characterization is only tentative because the few bonds cleaved by the enzyme could have a different structure. The enzyme is inactive towards N-acetyl-oligogalactosaminoglycan and chitosan. The endogalactosaminidase preparations also cleave high molecular weight galactosaminoglycan (obtained from Neurospora) into fragments greater than or equal to 10(4) daltons in molecular weight, and catalyze the release of Neurospora sporelings from the glass surfaces to which they are anchored. Galactosaminoglycan-cleaving and sporeling-releasing activities elute jointly from DEAE-cellulose columns. This observation provides further support for an earlier proposal that the sporelings are anchored to the glass by means of galactosaminoglycan molecules.
Keeping the arterial pH at 7.4 and PaCO2 at 40 mmHg in eight anesthetized dogs, we acutely raised plasma potassium concentration from 3.4 to 8.2 meq/1, then allowed it to decay back to control levels. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-blood electrical potential difference (pd) increased 13.2 mV per 10-fold increase in plasma [K+]. Again keeping arterial pH at 7.4 and PaCO2 at 40 mmHg, we elevated plasma [K+] in four dogs from 3.3 to 8.0 meq/1 and maintained this level for 6 h. We found 1) that the PD increased from a control value of +1.3 to +8.9mV, showing no tendency to decay over the 6 h; and 2) that the change in PD did not affect the distribution of Na+, K+, H+, Cl-, or HCO3- between blood and CSF over the 6 h. These results suggest that under these conditions the PD between CSF and blood may play no effective role in determining the distributions of these charged species by 6 h. These results are contrasted with recent findings which suggest that H+ and HCO3- are distributed according to passive forces between CSF and blood.
When polystyrene "latex" beads are centrifuged to equilibrium in gradients of Nalcoag 1030, Nalcoag 1034A and Ludox 130M, which are commercial formulations of colloidal silica, the beads at densities that may be markedly lower or higher than the bulk density. Addition to the gradient of small amounts of certain polymers restores the banding densities towards the expected value. These findings closely mimic previously observed "density shifts" of biological particles. A possible model for this anomalous behavior is discussed.
The resting cell membrane potential varies from -40 to -70 mV according to type of gland cell and species. The RP depends mainly on the large transmembrane concentration gradient for K maintained by a pump mechanism extruding Na and accumulating K. Since the Na permeability (PNa) is much smaller than PK, the Na concentration gradient is less important. In addition to the dominant electrodiffusional control of RP the Na pump itself contributes since the active transport of Na (out) exceeds that of the active K uptake. Gland cells are generally electrically coupled--i.e., the junctional membrane resistance is much lower than the surface membrane resistance. The coupling may be widespread (e.g., liver) or confined to one acinus (e.g., salivary gland and pancreas). The specific surface cell membrane resistance may be about 2000 omega cm2. A number of neurotransmitters and hormones control cellular transport processes by their action on surface cell membrane receptors. Agonist-receptor interaction causes prominent changes in membrane potential and resistance, in many cases of a complex nature. Most gland cell membranes so far investigated in detail appear to be electrically inexcitable; i.e., stimulation does not cause the appearance of action potentials (e.g., salivary glands, exocrine pancreas, and liver) but prominent exceptions to this are the endocrine pancreas (beta-cells) and the adrenal cortex. The main importance of agonist-induced membrane permeability changes is to alter the intracellular ion activities. An increase in [Na+] seems to be important whenever stimulation results in fluid transport and an increase in [Ca2+] triggers exocytosis.
The effect of  prolonged (10 days) dehydration on acid-base parameters of camel blood was examined. The pH and PCO2 levels rose significantly in the course of dehydration. This state was comparable with compensated non-respiratory alkalosis found in other animals. The plasma sodium, and magnesium levels rose significantly also. The plasma oxygen and calcium levels declined significantly. There were no significant changes in potassium and phosphate levels. It is concluded that the changes found in acid-base status following dehydration are further evidence of water preservation mechanisms in the dehydrated camel.
The effect of variables associated with the donor and with methods of collecting, processing, and storing platelets on the quality of platelets kept at ambient temperature was studied. Changes in structural integrity of platelets, decrease in pH, loss of aggregability, and kinetics in vivo of platelets tagged with 51Cr were used as indicators of the tolerance of platelets to storage. A platelet concentration of less than 2.5 x 10(6) per cu mm, a temperature of storage less than 24 C, and continuous, gentle, agitation were found to be essential for satisfactory preservation of platelet integrity, function, and post-transfusion survival. Platelets from female donors tolerated storage less well than did platelets from male donors, possibly because the lower hematocrit of blood collection from females resulted in greater initial acidity of the concentrate. A number of other variables analyzed appear to be of little or no consequence for successful platelet storage.
Binding of silver ions by the cells of Candida utilis involves their adsorption on the cell surface. It was found that 90% of all silver bound by the cells was localized in the fraction of cell walls and cytoplasmic membranes. The sensitivity of protoplasts to the toxic action of silver ions is much higher than that of intact cells. The toxic effect of silver ions is supposed to be related to changes in the functions of cytoplasmic membranes.
6,7 -Dideoxy-alpha-D-gluco-heptose 7-phosphonic acid, the isosteric phosphonate analogue of glucose 6-phosphate, was synthesized in six steps from the readily available precursor benzyl 4,6-O-benzylidene-alpha-D-glucopyranoside. The analogue is a substrate for yeast glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, showing Michaelis-Menten kinetics at pH7.5 and 8.0. At both pH values the Km values of the analogue are 4-5 fold higher and the values approx. 50% lower than those of the natural substrate. The product of enzymic dehydrogenation of the phosphonate analogue at pH8.5 is itself a substrate for gluconate 6-phosphate dehydrogenase.
Biological membranes must be viewed as highly dynamic, undergoing continuous structural fluctuations and changes in response to external perturbations. The study of liposomes by 31 P n.m.r. and fluorescence can reveal some of the motional characteristics of the different regions in a bilayer. Asymmetric lipid distribution and how this depends on the environment is also observed by n.m.r. The nature of the interaction of amine anaesthetics and of polypeptide antibodies with membranes is discussed in relation to their perturbing effect. The role of lipid mobility in modulating hormone-receptor interaction is discussed with reference to the binding of thyroid stimulating hormone.
The compound VUFB-6638 (N-/D-6-methyl-8-isoergolin-I-yl/N'-N'-diethylurea hydrogen maleinate) was administered for four consecutive days to lactating rats in daily oral doses of 0.1, 1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg. The adenohypophysial prolactin concentration decreased by 34% to 68%, respectively. Moreover, this compound reduced or even completely suppressed the lactation. In view of the assumed relations between prolactin and breast carcinoma, a potential use of the drug is noted.
Pepsin was spin-labelled with N-(1-oxyl-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piperidyl) bromoacetamide, possibly at the active site, at a beta-catboxyl group of a reactive aspartic acid. The spectrum of the spin-labelled pepsin showed that the spin probe was strongly immobilized (correlation time is greater than or equal to 10(-8) sec). Spin-labelled pepsin was thermally denatured at various temperatures and electron paramagnetic resonance (e.p.r.) spectra were taken at various times. Rates of denaturation estimated from the e.p.r. spectra at various temperatures showed that the enthalpy and entropy of thermal denaturation of spin-labelled pepsin at pH 3.5 were 48.0+/-4.9 kcal/mole and 214.7+/-14.5 e.u. respectively. Addition of conc. NaOH or 1 M acetate buffer at pH 6.0 sharpened e.p.r. spectra of the spin-labelled pepsin, indicating that the spin probe became mobilized by alkaline denaturation. Addition of urea caused unfolding of the protein which increased with the urea concentration, although only slight transition of conformational changes was observed in the e.p.r. spectra.
Since abnormalities in the renal handling of sodium and water in both the proximal and distal tubule have been described in primary hypothyroidism, this study was undertaken to examine renal tubular hydrogen secretion in this disorder. Metabolic acidosis was induced in hypothyroid rats (H) and their age matched controls (C) by the administration of an oral ammonium chloride load of 0.15 g/24 h/kg for three days. On day 3 animals were prepared for clearance and acid-base studies, receiving an infusion of Ringer's solution of 0.6 ml/hr/100 g during surgery and the experimental procedure. A 26% decrease in GFR (P less than 0.005) and a doubling in fractional excretion of sodium (P less than 0.02) were observed in H rats. The lowest blood pH and average bicarbonate concentration and the excretion of chloride were similar in the two groups, indicating that the acid load was reabsorbed and led to similar degrees of systemic acidification. Urine flow also was comparable in the two groups. Minimal urine pH after NH4Cl was 6.21 +/- 0.06 in H and 5.68 +/- 0.09 in C (P less than 0.001). Ammonium excretion was 28% (P less than 0.05) lower in H than in C. The defect in urine acidification in H was only partially corrected after 5 days on a low sodium diet and DOCA administration for 2 days. Fractional bicarbonate excretion at normal blood pH and bicarbonate concentration was not different in the two groups. These data indicate that hypothyroid rats have a mild defect in urine acidification and that it is localized predominantly in the distal tubule.
The effect of propranolol inhalation on sensitivity to methacholine inhalation was studied in normal and allergic rhinitis subjects to determine whether beta adrenergic blockade alters sensitivity to mediators in nonasthmatic atopic individuals. A partial beta adrenergic blockade is suggested as being instrumental in asthma. Hay fever patients studied showed similar effects and also developed asthma for the first time.
1 In rat isolated vas deferens, the isotonic contractile responses to low doses of noradrenaline or adrenaline were antagonized, and those to high doses were potentiated, by yohimbine, piperoxan, phentolamine and tolazoline. Effects due to intermediate doses were not affected, or were potentiated within about 30 min, following an initial inhibition. 2 The alpha-adrenoceptor blockers thus caused a shift to the right and an increase of the maximum height of log dose-response curves of alpha-adrenoceptor stimulants. For a given dose of antagonist, the onset was slower for the potentiating than for the blocking effect. 3 The shift to the right induced by piperoxan and yohimbine on dose-response curves of noradrenaline and adrenaline was analysed with the Schild plot, and the slopes obtained, around 0.3, were lower than expected from receptor theory. When cocaine was used to block neuronal uptake, the slopes were close to 1.0. 4 The increase in maximum response to noradrenaline and adrenaline induced by alpha-adrenoceptor blockers was dependent on the time of incubation, on the dose of antagonist, and on the initial height of responses to the agonist. A less pronounced potentiation was also obtained when acetylcholine was used as agonist. 5 The findings are explained in terms of receptor theory as being due to a dual effect of alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists; competitive antagonism proper, which may be disclosed after blockade of neuronal uptake, and an interaction at a different locus, which results in potentiation of the effects of noradrenaline and adrenaline.
The metal ion catalysed decomposition of the nucleotide diphosphate sugars, uridine diphosphate glucose, uriding diphosphate galactose, uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine, guanosine diphosphate mannose, and guanosine diphosphate fucose (UDPGlc, UDPGal, UDPGlc-NAc, GDPMan, and GDPFuc, respectively), has been studies as a function of pH. UDPDlc and UDPGal decompose readily to the a,2-cycle phosphate derivative of the sugar and uridine 5'-phosphoric acid (UMP) in the presence of Mn2+. Under all conditions tested, UDPGal decomposes two to three times more rapidly than does UDPGlc. GDPFuc is slowly degraded to free fucose under similar conditions; the other nucleotide diphosphate sugars are stable. The rate of reaction increases with increasing hydroxide ion concentration from pH 6.5 to 7.9 and with metal ion concentration from 10 to 200 mm. Several metal ions are effective catalysts; at pH 7.5 WITH 20 mM UDPGal and 20 mM metal ion, the following apparent first-order rate constants (min-1 x 10(4)) were obtained: Eu3+ 700; Mn2+, 70; Co2+ 27; Zn2+, 22; Ca2+, 3.0; Cu2+, 2.4; and Mg2+, 0. It appears that Mn2+ concentrations that have been used in studies with nucleotide diphosphate sugars at neutral pH can catalyze significant decomposition leading to erroneous interpretation of kinetic and incorporation experiments.
A procedure is described for the preparation of extensively purified beta-D-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.21) from the cytosol fraction of rat kidney. The specific activity of the beta-glucosidase in the high speed supernatant (100 000 X g, 90 min) fraction of rat kidney homogenate is 700-fold greater than that in the same fraction from heart, skeletal muscle, lung, spleen, brain or liver. beta-Glucosidase activity co-chromatographs with beta-D-galactosidase, beta-D-fucosidase, alpha-L-arabinosidase and beta-D-xylosidase activities through the last four column steps of the purification and their specific activities are 0.26, 0.39, 0.028 and 0.017 relative to that of beta-glucosidase, respectively. The specific activity of the apparently homogeneous beta-glucosidase is 115 000 nmol of glucose released from 4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside per mg protein per h. All five glycosidase activities possess similar pH dependency (pH optimum, 6--7) and heat lability, and co-migrate on polyacrylamide disc gels at pH 8.9 (RF, 0.67). beta-Glucosidase acitivity is inhibited competitively by glucono-(1 leads to 5)-lactone (KI, 0.61 mM) and non-competitively by a variety of sulfhydryl reagents including N-ethylmaleimide, p-chloromercuribenzoate, 5,5'-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), and iodoacetic acid. Although the enzyme will release glucose from p-nitrophenyl and 4-methylumbelliferyl derivatives of beta-D-glucose, it will not hydrolyze xylosyl-O-serine, beta-D-glucocerebroside, lactose, galactosylovalbumin or trehalose. The enzyme consists of a single polypeptide chain with a molecular weight of 50 000--58 000, has a sedimentation coefficient of 4.41 S and contains a relatively large number of acidic amino acids. A study of the distribution of beta-glucosidase activity in various regions of the dissected rat kidney indicates that the enzyme is probably contained in cells of the proximal convoluted tubule. The enzyme is also present in relatively large amounts in the villus cells, but not crypt cells, of the intestine. The physiological substrate and function of the enzyme are unknown.
The role of histamine as a mediator of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction was examined in intact anesthetized dogs. Antagonism of histamine vasoconstrictor (H1) receptors with a classic antihistaminic drug (chlorpheniramine) failed to prevent or modify the pulmonary vascular responses to hypoxia (10% O2). Blockade of histamine vasodilator (H2) receptors with a newly synthesized blocking agent (metiamide) potentiated the vasoconstriction induced by hypoxia and prevented the normal increase in heart rate. Combined H1- and H2-receptor blockade also did not prevent or reduce the hypoxic pulmonary pressor response, although it did effectively abolish the cardiovascular actions of infused histamine. In other dogs, histamine infused (3.6 mug/kg per min) during hypoxia attenuated the pulmonary vasoconstriction induced by hypoxia. The results imply that, in the dog, histamine does not mediate hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. However, histamine does appear to be released during hypoxia, and it may play a role in modulating the pulmonary vascular responses to hypoxia by opposing the hypoxia induced vasoconstriction. The results also imply that histamine may be responsible for the increase in heart rate during hypoxia.
A brief survey is given of some of the most frequent extracardiac causes which may provoke disturbances of rhythm. The importance of psychogenic and metabolic factors is emphasized. Additional organic lesions cannot be excluded in every case.
Previous studies on the pharmacokinetics of 3H-digoxin in the rat have been based on total radioactivity in the plasma, even though the drug is extensively metabolized in this species. A comparison of total radioactivity vs. unchanged drug in rat plasma after administration of 3H-digoxin clearly showed the need to separate digoxin from its metabolites. The pharmacokinetics of digoxin were therefore examined using solvent extraction and thin-layer chromatography to isolate unchanged drug. Digoxin levels after a 1 mg/kg iv dose were measured in the plasma and urine of adult male rats in which the bile duct or the ureters had been ligated, as well as in sham-operated controls. In all cases, digoxin concentrations were best described by a two-compartment open model. Digoxin was rapidly eliminated from the plasma of controls, with a half-life of 2.5 hr, a volume of distribution of 3.6 liter/kg, and a renal clearance somewhat lower than the glomerular filtration rate. No significant change in these parameters was observed in rats with bile duct ligation. The total body clearance of 5.77 ml/min in the controls was reduced by only 10% in the bile duct-ligated rats. In animals with bilateral ureter ligation, the body clearance was reduced by 30% and the plasma half-life of digoxin was increased to 4 hr, although no significant change in the apparent volume of distribution was noted. Approximately 60% of the total body clearance was unaffected by bile duct and ureter ligations, and was assumed to be due to biotransformation. Biliary excretion was found to be important for digoxigenin bisdigitoxoside, inasmuch as rats with bile duct ligation showed elevated metabolite levels in the plasma as well as a 3-fold increase in renal excretion of the bisglycoside.
Conformational changes accompanying the different modes of aggregation of tobacco mosaic virus protein (TMV-protein) were investigated using circular dichroism (CD) and absorption difference spectra in the range of aromatic absorption. Comparing wild-type protein and mutant Ni 2068 (Tyr-139 leads to Cys-139) a tentative localization of aromatic amino acids in the three-dimensional structure is rendered possible. In all modes of aggregation the CD spectra are determined by intrasubunit interactions between aromatic residues, in particular Trp-17 and Trp-52 as well as Tyr-70, Tyr-72 and Tyr-139. The Trp-17-Trp-52 interaction was found to be highly sensitive towards changes of the quaternary structure especially with respect to helical aggregates. This suggests that the environment of the two tryptophan residues is of crucial importance in the three-dimensional structure of the subunit; in the course of aggregation intersubunit interactions compete with the specific intrasubunit Trp-17--Trp52 interactions. It is suggested that Try-70 and Tyr-72 form hydrogen bonds in a strongly hydrophobic environment. Formation of the double disc decreases the rotatory strength, pointing to an increase in conformational flexibility. Spectroscopic and chemical evidence prove that Tyr-70, Tyr-72 and Tyr-139 are in close neighbourhood. Double disc formation by lowering the pH (pH 8 LEADS TO 6.9, I = 0.1 M) or increasing the ionic strength (pH 8, I = 0.1 LEADS TO 0.6 M) is reflected by identical spectral effects in the environment of Tyr-70 - Tyr-72. However the interaction between Trp-17 and Trp-52 indicates significant differences in the conformation which may be important for the formation of higher aggregates, i.e. 'lockwashers', helices, and 'stacked discs'.
The setting up of a computing device to exploit the files of first transports at the MONTPELLIER SAMU was started essentially in order to constitute a document both accurate and of easy access, able to memorize the physical and mental behaviour of a patient in a transient state. The results thus obtained include: 1 -- An analytical study with a part devoted to general data such as the number of injured people or of patients, the number of calls from various sources, the means of intervention etc. and a more specific part dealing with type of accident the determination of the traumatic impacts, the first therapy etc.; 2 -- A synthetical study that constitutes the second phase of the dealing with information thanks to the drawing up of graphs indicating the number of calls per accident according to the time, the age, the number of serious cases etc.
The major group of aminopeptidases (EC 3.4.11.-) of intermediate electrophoretic mobility, from Tineola bisselliella larvae, hav been fractionated into six bands by preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the properties of these fractions investigated. They resemble each other in their pH optima of 8.2, their molecular weight of 240 000, their responses to various active site inhibitors and metal cations, and their specificities towards seventeen L-amino-acyl-beta-naphthylamide substrates. The derivatives of methionine, leucine, alanine, lysine, arginine and glutamic acid were those most rapidly hydrolysed. They appear to be true aminopeptidases hydrolysing amino acid amides, dipeptides and oligopeptides from the N-terminal end.
The relative rate of the hydrolysis of 2-(5-n-alkyl)furoyl-alpha-chymotrypsin reaches a maximum with the propyl derivative. The Arrhenius plots for the hydrolyses of the 2-furoyl-, 2-(5-ethyl)furoyl-, and 2-(5-n-propyl)furoyl-alpha-chymotrypsins display a discontinuity, while the plots obtained with the ramaining furoyl derivatives 5-methyl, 5-n-butyl, and 5-n-amyl are linear. We conclude that the deacylation of the furoyl derivatives of alpha-chymotrypsin involves a minimum of two elementary reaction steps. Depending upon the reaction conditions, rate enhancement specificity appears to be either entropy or enthalpy controlled.
The available data suggest that at 2 degrees and 5 degrees with a 12-day long storage in unpacked and in polymeric film packed forcemeat there occurs no propagation of the enterococci. At 22-24 degrees the multiplication of Str. faecalis var. liquefaciens proceeded similarly both in packed and unpacked forcemeat. When the temperature in the central part of the cutlets prepared from the enterococci-contaminated forcemeat reaches 7-80 degrees the bulk of the Str. faecalis var liquefaciens cells perishes, but even at 80 degrees there survive individual heat-resistant cells.
The increasing number of respiratory insufficiency, as well as of pulmonary complications after burns and their role in the post-traumatic mortality are pointed out by the author. The pathophysiological processes responsible for the development of post-traumatic pulmonary complications are shortly resumed. In respect of the clinical picture, three groups are distinguished by the author. One case is reported in detail. In the development of post-traumatic respiratory insufficiency important role is attributed by the author to the syndromes of micro-embolism. This supposition is supported by the laboratory examination of 10 patients. Finally the problems of prevention and therapy are discussed and the importance of the iatrogenic damages is emphasized.
Propanidid was used for the induction of anaesthesia at Caesarean section in 50 healthy mothers. All parturients were considered to have normal placental function. Anaesthesia was maintained with nitrous oxide, oxygen, muscle relaxant and controlled ventilation. The patients were tilted laterally with a 15 degrees rubber wedge during the procedure in order to obviate the effects of aorta-caval occlusion. At the time of delivery, arterial blood was drawn from the mother and from the vessels of a double clamped section of umbilical cord, for blood-gas analysis. The results obtained are compared with those previously reported in a similar series anaesthetised with thiopentone, gas, oxygen and relaxant. Maternal blood-gas and acid-base levels were similar in the two groups at delivery. The clinical status of the infants in the present series, as judged by the modified Apgar score at 2 minutes after birth, was satisfactory. Umbilical venous and arterial pH values after propanidid were both 0-054 units (P less than 0-001) less than those following thiopentone; and average base deficits were 3-1 (Uv) and 3-9 (Ua) mEq/litre greater after propanidid (P less than 0-001). Mean oxygen levels in the umbilical cord bloods were 8-0 (Uv) and 3-5 (Ua) mmHg lower (P less than 0-001 & P less than 0-025 respectively) in the propanidid group. Derived oxygen contents was also significantly less than in the previous thiopentone series. (Ma-Uv) and (Ma-Ua) gradients were 0-053 and 0-051 pH units higher after propanidid than that following thiopentone (P less than 0-001). Mean (Ma-Uv) and (Ma-Ua) base deficits were 3-5 and 3-9 mEq/litre greater (P less than 0-001). Five patients offered definite evidence of factual recall, of whom three experienced pain. Propanidid, therefore, appeared to be associated with a greater degree of foetal acidaemia than did thiopentone. In addition, painful factual recall during surgery was encountered in 6 percent of cases. It is concluded that propanidid, although theoretically offering advantages over thiopentone to the obstetric anaesthetist, in practice, did not fulfil this promise.
In non hypercapnic hypoxia (inhalation of a 4,5% O2 mixture during 10 minutes) blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac output, femoral and carotid blood flow inhance so that, in less extent, vertebral blood flow. Such a reaction is consequent with an hypoxic stimulation of adrenal glands.
Seventeen strains of nitrogen-fixing bacteria, isolated from different habitats on hydrogen and carbon dioxide as well as on other substrates, morphologically resembled each other. All strains, including Mycobacterium flavum 301, grew autotrophically with hydrogen. The isolate strain 6 was sensitive to oxygen when dependent on N2 as nitrogen source, a consequence of the sensitivity of its nitrogenase towards oxygen. At the same time, strain 6 was sensitive to hydrogen when growing autotrophically on N2 as nitrogen source, but hydrogen did not affect acetylene reduction by these cells.
"Biosynthetic" L-threonine dehydratase was purified to homogeneous state with yield 29% of total activity from E. coli K-12. The cells were disrupted by means of ultra sound. Nucleic acids and nucleoproteins were precipitated with protamine sulphate, the proteins were fractioned with (NH4)2SO4, by gel filtration through Sephadex G-25 followed by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose using stepways elution by changing the pH-values. The homogenity of the enzyme was shown by polyacrylamide gel disc electrophoresis in the presence of dodecylsulphate. The enzyme consists of equal subunits having a molecular weight about 57000. The polyacrylamide gel disc electrophoresis had shown that the native enzyme consists of a set of oligomeric forms. The multiplisity of molecular organization of the enzyme was relfected in complicated kinetic behavior: at pH greater than 9 on the plots of initial reaction rate (upsilon) versus initial substrate concentration ([S]0) there were four inflexion points (two intermediate plateaux) the position and deepness of which depended on enzyme concentration. Kinetic properties of the highly purified enzyme and the enzyme in crude cell extracts at pH 9.3 and 7.4 were identical. At pH 8,3 on the upsilon versus [S]0 plots appeared two inflexion points (one intermediate plateau), the position of which practically did not depend on enzyme concentration in the reaction mixture but strongly depended on the enzyme concentration in the stock solution. Repeated polyacrylamide gel disc electrophoresis of several oligomeric forms isolated by the first electrophoresis had shown that oligomeric forms underwent a slow polymerization. It is suggested that "biosynthetic" L-threonine dehydratase from E. coli K-12 is a set of multiple oligomeric forms having different kinetic parameters. Probably, each form of the enzyme has a "simple" kinetics characterized by hyperbolic or sigmoidal shape of upsilon versus [S]0 plots. The rate of equilibrium between the oligomeric forms is small in comparison with the enzyme reaction velosity, that lead to the complex kinetic curves appearing as a result of summing up the kinetics inherent to the individual forms.
Urticaria is a problem often as vexing to the physician as to the patient. The approach to the patient with hives first demands a search for the etiology, whether endogenous and triggered by emotions or occult systemic disease, exogenous and triggered by allergy to inhaled or ingested antigens, or physical and due to abnormal sensitivity to heat, cold, light, or pressure. Often a fruitless search, the diagnostic evaluation must be accompanied by appropriate symptomatic therapy requiring familiarity with the antihistamines and their relative advantages in the various forms of urticaria. Elimination diets are of diagnostic as well as therapeutic value: pencillin-free, yeast-free, and salicylate-free diets are particularly useful. Therapeutic trials of tetracycline, nystatin and griseofulvin may be helpful, while corticosteroids and specific desensitization are rarely of value.
Bone marrow transplantation is emerging as a viable therapeutic approach to a number of diseases that are usually or uniformly fatal. We review here recent experiences in bone marrow transplantation in man at UCLA and in various other institutions throughout the world. We examine marrow transplantation in immunodeficiency diseases, acute leukemia, and aplastic anemia and consider the problems of infection in the transplant recipients. The applications of tissue typing to marrow transplantation and immunologic manipulations, which may influence engraftment and graft-versus-host disease, are also reported.
Two proteinase inhibitors, designated as inhibitors I and II, were purified from adzuki beans (Phaseolus angularis) by chromatographies on DEAE- and CM-cellulose, and gel filtration on a Sephadex G-100 column. Each inhibitor shows unique inhibitory activities. Inhibitor I was a powerful inhibitor of trypsin [EC 3.4.21.4], but essentially not of chymotrypsin ]EC 3.4.21.1]. On the other hand, inhibitor II inhibited chymotrypsin more strongly than trypsin. The molecular weights estimated from the enzyme inhibition were 3,750 and 9,700 for inhibitors I and II, respectively, assuming that the inhibitions were stoichiometric and in 1 : 1 molar ratio. The amino acid compositions of both inhibitors closely resemble those of low molecular weight inhibitors of other leguminous seeds: they contain large amounts of half-cystine, aspartic acid and serine, and little or no hydrophobic and aromatic amino acids. Inhibitor I lacks both tyrosine and tryptophan residues. The molecular weights were calculated to be 7,894 and 8,620 for inhibitors I and II, respectively. The reliability of these molecular weights was confirmed by the sedimentation equilibrium and 6 M guanidine gel filtration methods. On comparison with the values obtained from enzyme inhibition, it was concluded that inhibitor I and two trypsin inhibitory sites on the molecule, whereas inhibitor II had one chymotrypsin and one trypsin inhibitory sites on the molecule.
A well-behaved water soluble iron-porphyrin system, meso-tetra-(4-carboxyphenyl) porphinato iron (III) was synthesized. Its solution behavior is described using visable and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The complex exists in solution as three distinct forms of bridged dimers, oxo, hydroxo and aquo, with the following pK's: oxo + H+ in equilibrium hydroxo, pK = 9.58; hydroxo + H+ in equilibrium aquo, pK = 6.72. In the presence of excess imidazole the second pK is found to be 7.05. Detailed analysis of the interaction of the hydroxo-bridged form with imidazole is presented. It is found that one dimer unit simultaneously binds two imidazole molecules, with an over-all equilibrium constant log Keq = -1.22. EPR spectra are presented for the various forms of iron-porphyrin discussed.
1. L-asparaginase from M. phlei was purified about 170-fold with an 11% yield. The purification procedure consisted of: fractionation with ammonium sulphate; adsorption of contaminating proteins on calcium phosphate gel; chromatography on Sephadex G-150 and DEAE-cellulose. The specific activity of the final preparation was 32.6 i.u./mg protein. 2. Molecular weight of the enzyme as determined by Sephadex G-100 filtration amounted to 126 000. Optimum pH was 8.8-9.2. The enzyme did not hydrolyse L-glutamine over the pH range 4-9, and was inhibited by D-asparagine. The apparent Michaelis constant for L-asparagine was 0.7 mM; energy of activation, 9800 cal/mole. 3. On polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis the final preparation revealed two protein bands, one of which was coincident with the enzyme activity.
The collagens are the major structural glycoproteins of connective tissues. A unique primary structure and a multiplicity of post-translational modification reactions are required for normal fibrillogenesis. The post-translational modifications include hydroxylation of prolyl and lysyl residues, glycosylation, folding of the molecule into triple-helical conformation, proteolytic conversion of precursor procollagen to collagen, and oxidative deamination of certain lysyl and hydroxylysyl residues. Any defect in the normal mechanisms responsible for the synthesis and secretion of collagen molecules or the deposition of these molecules into extracellular fibers could result in abnormal fibrillogenesis; such defects could result in a connective tissue disease. Recently, defects in the regulation of the types of collagen synthesized and in the enzymes involved in the post-translational modifications have been found in heritable diseases of connective tissue. Thus far, the primary heritable disorders of collagen metabolism in man include lysyl hydroxylase deficiency in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VI, p-collagen peptidase deficency in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VII, decreased synthesis of type III collagen in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV, lysyl oxidase deficency in S-linked cutis laxa and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type V, and decreased synthesis of type I collagen in osteogenesis imperfecta.
4-aminopyridine (4-AP) at micromolar concentrations, increases the end-plate potential amplitude in curarized preparations and the mean quantal content in every preparation tested, but the spontaneous release is not modified by 4-AP. These results can explain the anticurare activity observed in the wole animal or in vitro. 4-AP prolongs the falling phase of the muscle action potential without change in the muscle membrane potential.
Reaction of phenylglyoxal with aspartate transcarbamylase and its isolated catalytic subunit results in complete loss of enzymatic activity. This modification reaction is markedly influenced by pH and is partially reversible upon dialysis. Carbamyl phosphate or carbamyl phosphate with succinate partially protect the catalytic subunit and the native enzyme from inactivation by phenylglyoxal. In the native enzyme complete protection from inactivation is afforded by N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-aspartate. The decrease in enzymatic activity correlates with the modification of 6 arginine residues on each aspartate transcarbamylase molecule, i.e. 1 arginine per catalytic site. The data suggest that the essential arginine is involved in the binding of carbamyl phosphate to the enzyme. Reaction of the single thiol on the catalytic chain with 2-chloromercuri-4-nitrophenol does not prevent subsequent reaction with phenylglyoxal. If N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-aspartate is used to protect the active site we find that phenylglyoxal also causes the loss of activation of ATP and inhibition by CTP. The rate of loss of heterotropic effects is exactly the same for both nucleotides indicating that the two opposite regulatory effects originate at the same location on the enzyme, or are transmitted by the same mechanism between the subunits, or both.
The effect of multiple oral administration of the hypocholesterolemic agent cholestyramine (a strongly basic anion-exchange resin) on the metabolism of salicylazosulfapyridine by microflora present in the colon and cecum was assessed in conventional rats by following the time course of salicylazosulfapyridine and its metabolites in the urine and feces. The intestinal metabolism of salicylazosulfapyridine (a single 100 mg/kg oral dose), which involves reduction of the azo linkage by bacterial azo reductases and the liberation of sulfapyridine and 5-aminosalicylic acid (potential active metabolites of the drug), was markedly inhibited by the resin (250 mg/kg oral doses at -2, +2 and +6 hours), resulting in an enhanced fecal excretion of intact salicylazosulfapyridine. The existence of a rank-order correlation between the in vitro binding of salicylazosulfapyridine, sulfapyridine and 5-aminosalicylic acid to the resin and their fecal excretion pattern in resin-treated animals suggests that a direct cholestyramine-salicylazosulfapyridine interaction occurred within the intestinal tract and that in the bound state, the azo bond of the drug was inaccessible to bacterial azo reductases. These findings suggest that chronic oral administration of cholestyramine to patients with ulcerative colitis who are receiving salicylazosulfapyridine could result in a significant reduction in the absorption and metabolism of the drug and hence, in its therapeutic efficacy.
The hydrolysis of the phospholipids of intact human serum high density lipoprotein 3 (HDL3) by pure alpha-phospholipase A2 from Crotalus adamanteus was studied by pH-stat titration. The enzyme quantitatively hydrolyzed phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine and left sphinogomyelin intact, yielding a stable and water-soluble modified HDL. Lysophospholipids and free fatty acids, the products of hydrolysis, remained in the lipoprotein. When 1 mol of defatted bovine serum albumin/mol of substrate phospholipids was added to the reaction mixture, up to 60% of the fatty acids and 85% of the lysophospholipids were removed from the modified lipoprotein. The immunological reactivity of the hydrolyzed HDL remained unaltered in both the presence and absence of albumin. The changes in the physical properties of the lipoprotein during hydrolysis were rather small, the most notable being an increase in the hydrated density and in the electrophoretic mobility in alkaline buffers. The hydrolysis followed an apparent first order time course with product inhibition (KI) and yielded values of kcat/Km = 7 X 10(5 M(-1)s(-1) and KI congruent to 1 X 10(-4) M. Addition of albumin to the reaction mixture relieved the product inhibition without any alteration of the kinetic parameters. High concentrations of albumin protected some of the substrate phospholipids from hydrolysis, presumably through complexation to the lipoprotein. The Arrhenius plot for the experimental first order rate constant in the absence of albumin (kexp = kcat (KI/Km)) was linear between 15 degrees and 47 degrees, indicating the absence of any phospholipid phase transitions and yielding an activation energy of 15.2 kcal/mol. From the accessibility of the HDL phospholipids to phospholipase A2 one concludes that the phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine are located at, or are in rapid equilibrium with, the surface of this lipoprotein. It also appears that these phospholipids are not essential for maintaining the supramolecular properties of the lipoprotein in vitro. Thsu the study of the modified Hdl should provide valuable information concenring the structure and function of this lipoprotein particularly with regard to the role played by shiingomyelin.
Membrane vesicles isolated from E. coli generate a trans-membrane proton gradient of 2 pH units under appropriate conditions when assayed by flow dialysis. Using the distribution of weak acids to measure the proton gradient (deltapH) and the distribution of the lipophilic cation triphenyl-methylphosphonium to measure the electrical potential across the membrane (delta psi), the vesicles are shown to generate an electrochemical proton gradient (deltamuH+) of approximately-180 mV at pH 5.5 in the presence of ascorbate and phenazine methosulfate, the major component of which is a deltapH of about -110mV. As external pH is increased, deltapH decreases, reaching 0 at pH 7.5 and above, while delta psi remains at about-75 mV and internal pH remains at pH 7.5. Moreover, the ability of various electron donors to drive transport is correlated with their ability to generate deltamuH+. In addition, deltapH and delta psi can be varied reciprocally in the presence of valinomycin and nigericin. These data and others (manuscript in preparation) provide convincing support for the role of chemiosmotic phenomena in active transport.
Response of the fetal kidney to metabolic acidosis was studied in five fetal lambs, 115-125 days gestation, in order to evaluate the renal contribution to elimination of hydrogen ion during intra-uterine development. Experiments were conducted on healthy unanesthetized fetuses, intact in utero, with catheters implanted at hysterotomy into a fetal femoral artery and vein and into the bladder via the urachus, four or more days prior to the study. A metabolic acidosis was induced by infusion of isotonic lactic acid, 15 m mole/kg, intravenously over a period of 90 minutes. Serial arterial samples were taken and urine collected in fractions before, during and for three hours following the infusion, for measurements of pH, bicarbonate, lactate and electrolytes as well as urine output. During the infusion, urine pH fell from 6.65 to 6.25 and was 6.34 three hours later (Figs. 1 to 4, Tabs. III to IV). Lactic acid infusion caused a prompt increase in urine output from a mean rate of 0.12 to a maximum of 0.28 ml/kg/min at the end of the infusion, returning to control rates three hours later. Lactate excretion increased from 0.05 to a maximum of 4.6 mumole/kg/min at the end of infusion; titratable acid increased from 0.22 to a maximum of 4 muEq/kg/min; the rates of excretion of lactate and titratable acid were still higher than control at the end of three hours. Ammonia excretion increased from 0.21 to a maximum of 0.56 muEq/kg/min three hours after the end of infusion. The acid infusion caused a small but significant fall in excretion of bicarbonate. During the 90 minutes of infusion and over the following three hours, about 800 mumole lactate was excreted while net acid excretion over the same period was no more than half that amount. The diuresis was also accompanied by a net loss of sodium and chloride, the excretion of these ions increasing more than threefold following acid infusion; excretion of potassium decreased to one-third its rate prior to the infusion. During the 90 minutes of infusion, blood pH fell from 7.36 to 7.13, base deficit rose from 3.8 to 16.4 mEq/L and lactate rose from 2.2 to 14.8 mM/L; there was also a small but significant rise in both blood PCO2 and PO2 (Figs. 1 to 2, Tabs. I to II). During the following three hours of recovery, pH rose gradually to 7.29, base deficit and lactate fell to 7.4 mEq/L and 8.7 mM/L respectively. Since renal excretion of net acid and lactate was small, the decrease in blood base deficit and lactate levels during the recovery must therefore be mainly due to equilibration in various fetal compartments as well as placental transfer. These experiments indicate that, in the lamb fetus, intact in utero, the kidney although limited by immaturity of several mechanisms, is capable of responding to an acid load and thus can make a small contribution to fetal homeostasis. The increase in excretion of net acid is accompanied by loss of sodium and chloride in the urine.
The purification of axonal membranes of crustaceans was followed by measuring enrichment in [3H]tetrodotoxin binding capacity and in Na+, K+-ATPase activity. A characteristic of these membranes is their high content of lipids and their low content of protein as compared to other types of plasmatic membranes. The axonal membrane contains myosin-like, actin-like, tropomyosin-like, and tubulin-like proteins. It also contains Na+, K+-ATPase and acetylcholinesterase. The molecular weights of these two enzymes after solubilization are 280,000 and 270,000, respectively. The molecular weights of the catalytic subunits are 96,000 for ATPase and 71,000 for acetylcholinesterase. We confirmed the presence of a nicotine binding component in the axonal membrane of the lobster but we have been unable to find [3H]nicotine binding to crab axonal membranes. The binding to axonal membranes og of the sodium channel, has been studied in detail. The dissociation constant for the binding of [3H]tetrodotoxin to the axonal membrane receptor is 2.9 nM at pH 7.4. The concentration of the tetrodotoxin receptor in crustacean membranes is about 10 pmol/mg of membrane protein, 7 times less than the acetylcholinesterase, 30 times less than the Na+, K+-ATPase, and 30 times less than the nicotine binding component in the lobster membrane. A reasonable estimate indicates that approximately only one peptide chain in 1000 constitutes the tetrodotoxin binding part of the sodium channel in the axonal membrane. Veratridine, which acts selectively on the resting sodium permeability, binds to the phospholipid part of the axonal membrane. [3H]Veratridine binding to membranes parallels the electrophysiological effect. Veratridine and tetrodotoxin have different receptor sites. Although tetrodotoxin can repolarize the excitable membrane of a giant axon depolarized by veratridine, veratridine does not affect the binding of [3H]tetrodotoxin to purified axonal membranes. Similarly, tetrodotoxin does not affect the binding of [3H]veratridine to axonal membranes. Scorpion neurotoxin I, a presynaptic toxin which affects both the Na+ and the K+ channels, does not interfere with the binding of [3H]tetrodotoxin or [3H]veratridine to axonal membranes. Tetrodotoxin, veratridine, and scorpion neurotoxin I, which have in common the perturbation of the normal functioning of the sodium channel, act upon three different types of receptor sites.
The stability of oxyhemoglobin S during mechanical shaking was enhanced by the addition of human serum albumin. The stabilizing effect was maximum when the concentration of serum albumin approached that of oxyhemoglobin, suggesting a molecular level interaction between them. The effects of serum albumin on oxyhemoglobin A were essentially similar to those on oxyhemoglobin S. Deoxy- and methemoglobins were also stabilized by serum albumin. The addition of human serum albumin to a solution containing sickle cell oxyhemoglobin slowly formed a compound which had an absorbance peak at 620 nm. After purification by Sephadex G-200 column chromatography, this compound was identified as methemalbumin. Comparison of the rates of formation of methemalbumin from hemoglobin with various ligand states and human serum albumin showed that the rate of formation from hemichrome was much faster than from met-, oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin. About 60% of the heme was transferred from hemichrome to albumin when the mixture was kept standing at room temperature for 5 min, in contrast to only 5% from methemoglobin. This result suggests that hemichrome, rather than methemoglobin, is the intermediate in the formation of methemalbumin from oxyhemoglobin and human serum albumin. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that the rate of formation of methemalbumin was faster at alkaline pH values than at acid pH values. Serum albumin from various animal sources showed different stabilizing effects. The formation of methemalbumin from these animal albumins was far less than that from human albumin.
Treatment of DBA/2 (H-2d) mice with bacterial endotoxin prior to transplantation of their spleen and lymph node cells into immunosuppressed AKR (H-2k) mice prevented acute mortality from graft-versus-host (GVH) disease. AKR mice that received immunocompetent cells from untreated DBA/2 mice had a median survival time (MST) of 13 days. In contrast, AKR mice that received immunocompetent cells from endotoxin-treated DBA/2 donors had an MST of 54 days. Endotoxin treatment of AKR recipients was not essential for preventing mortality from acute GVH disease. Chimerism was proved by demonstrating that the lymphoid cells of long-term surviving AKR mice had the characteristics of DBA/2 lymphoid cells as measured by their response in mixed leukocyte culture (MLC) tests. Spleen cells from endotoxin-treated DBA/2 mice were able to stimulate, and to be stimulated by, AKR spleen cells in MLC assays. Furthermore, spleen cells from endotoxin-treated DBA/2 mice did not suppress the responses of DBA/2 or AKR spleen cells in 'three-party' MLC tests.
The present study on 55 consecutive patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) draws attention to the relationship between different enzyme maxima in AMI, with special reference to serum gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (S-GT). In more than 60% of the patients the S-GT was increased during the hospital stay. The S-GT rise nearly always began during the first days,  reached a maximum within 5--8 days and normalized with 2--3 weeks. We failed to find the late increase in S-GT reported by others. The rise of S-GT is particularly common in patients with inferior infarction, with or without right ventricular involvement. We conclude that S-GT activity is not a useful early or late indicator of AMI but a very sensitive test for hepatic dysfunction in patients with AMI.
Aspartokinase I - homoserine dehydrogenase I from Escherichia coli K-12, a homotetrameric enzyme, dissociates into dimers upon alkaline treatment. Both aspartokinase and homoserine dehydrogenase inactivation, as well as desensitazion towards L-threonine, occur in a multi-step process. Dithiothreitol stabilizes a dimeric form retaining full activity and sensitivity; L-homoserine stabilizing another dimeric form devoid of aspartokinase activity and retaining a substantial dehydrogenase activity insensitive toward L-threonine. A model is proposed showing that dissociation into dimers occurs in a first step, the resulting dimer losing both aspartokinase and homoserine dehydrogenase sensitivity in two subsequent steps involving the formation of intrachain disulfide bonds.
It is confirmed that N. nigricollis venom contains several phospholipases one of these is a basic phospholipase A. This enzyme is toxic for mice when injected intravenously. In vitro it reacts on egg yolk lecithin producing lysolecithin and prevents the phenomenon of blood clotting. An immunological identity has been established between this basic phospholipase and two acidic phospholipases present in the same venom.
Mosquito-borne arboviruses are prevalent throughout subarctic regions of Canada and Alaska, principally in the boreal forest extending between latitudes 53 and 66 degrees N, but they have been identified in tundra regions as far north as 70 degrees N. All mosquito-borne agents have been bunyaviruses, comprising principally the snowshoe hare subtype of California encephalitis (CE) virus, but also Northway virus. Mosquito vectors comprise several Aedes species and Culiseta inornata, all of which have supported replication of CE virus following incubation at 13 degrees C or lower temperatures. Isolation of virus from wild-caught larvae points towards transovarial transfer. Principal vertebrate reservoirs of infection are mammals, especially snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) and ground squirrels (Citellus undulatus). Where the boreal forest merges into prairie grassland around 53 degrees N, Culex tarsalis mosquitoes become prevalent, and an alphavirus, western equine encephalomyelitis, is detected more frequently than CE virus.
1. Hydrolyses of phenyl alpha-maltoside and its derivatives with various substituents (p-NO2, p-C1, p-CH3, p-C2H5, and p-C(CH3)3) catalyzed by saccharifying alpha-amylase from B. subtilis3 [EC 3.2.1.1] were studied under conditions such that the products were only maltose and the corresponding phenols (1), in order to determine quantitatively the anomeric form of the sugar produced from each substrate. 2. At the optimum pH of this enzyme (pH-5.4), maltose released from all the substituted substrates studied was entirely in the beta-form. These results are in remarkable contrast to the previous finding that alpha-maltose is exclusively produced from unsubstituted phenyl alpha-maltoside by this enzyme (2). 3. At pH 6.18 and 6.73, maltose produced from unsubstituted phenyl alpha-maltoside (M) or p-tert-butylphenyl alpha-maltoside (PTBM) was a mixture of alpha- and beta-anomers, the ratio being dependent on pH as follows: For M, the percentage of alpha-anomer was 100% (pH 5.4), 80 (pH 6.18), and 55% (pH 6.73), whereas for PTBM, the percentage of beta-anomer was 100% (pH 5.4), 75% (pH 6.18), and 60% (pH 6.73).
The interaction of insulin with human circulating granulocytes was studied with the use of 125I-insulin. Human granulocytes, isolated from blood by the Byum technique, showed high insulin-degrading activity in vitro which almost obscured the presence of specific, high affinity binding sites. Degradation, measured by trichloroacetic acid precipitation and by binding to well characterized insulin receptors on cultured human lymphocytes (IM-9 line), was due to extracellular as well as cell-bound enzymes. Degradation was enhanced by Ca2+ and thiols and inhibited by various protease inhibitors and sulfhydryl-blocking reagents. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (5 X 10(-4) M), a serine protease inhibitor, was the most potent and inhibited 125I-insulin degradation by 80 to 90%. Tert-butyl hydroperoxide (2 X 10(-3) M), a glutathione-oxidizing reagent, inhibited degradation by 35 to 50%, possibly due to an effect on a glutathione-insulin transhydrogenase. Neither of the inhibitors affected cell viability. In the presence of inhibitors of degradation, binding sites for insulin with high affinity were detected, which by multiple criteria were true insulin receptors. Binding to these sites was rapid, saturable, and reversible with about 1000 sites/cell. The Hill coefficient for binding was 0.7, and the Scatchard plot of B/F versus B was curvilinear, due to site-site interactions of the negative cooperative type; the latter were demonstrated directly by kinetic studies. As shown previously for all other insulin receptors, binding was highly pH-dependent, and insulin analogues had affinities for these sites that closely correlated with their biological potencies.
The dynamics of interaction of complexes of synthetic polynucleotides (polyinosinic and polycitidylic acid--poly (rI)-poly (rC), and polyguanylic and polycytidylic acid--poly (rG)-poly (rC)) with cells as well as the dynamics of interferon accumulation and development of antiviral effect against some RNA viruses were studied in primary chick embryo cell (CEC) cultures. Four phases were observed in the development of the antiviral effect of synthetic polynucleotides: adsorption, increase, marked antiviral effect and waning. The duration and extent of the antiviral effect depended upon the activity and the dose of the preparation and less so upon virus type. At the same time, the dynamics of the development of the antiviral effect in early stages differed significantly depending on the virus model.
The renal papilla has a double blood supply - from both the vasa recta and the calyceal arteries. The importance of the latter supply is not established. A case of polyarteritis associated with papillary necrosis is reported, in which the calyceal vessels, supplying the area, show acute necrotizing arteritis and occlusion. The pathophysiological and clinical implications are discussed.
I describe a simple, single-tube batch fractionation procedure for separating MM and MB isoenzymes of creatine kinase on a macroporous strong anion exchanger (AG MP-1, Bio-Rad Laboratories). The isoenzymes can be separated in less than 3 min, with a resulting dilution of the serum with no more than an equal volume of buffer. Without sample concentration or spectrofluorometric measurement, the procedure detects 4 U of MB isoenzyme per liter. Sensitivity is limited by the sensitivity and precision of the method of measurement. The CV for the fractionation can be held to less than 4.0% at 65 U of MB per liter. Current fractionation methods are compared to the proposed procedure. With use of a discrete analyzer (Du Pont aca) the mean MB activity in a population free of heart disease was 3.2 +/- 3.0 U/liter (range, 0 to 8 U/liter). The kinetics and stability of isolated isoenzymes are reported, indicating that advisability of storing or pre-incubating samples with mercaptoethanol.
Canine cardiac lymph was studied after acute experimental myocardial infarction. The lymph potassium concentration remained the same, the lymph potassium content increased, the lymph pH decreased, and the lymph flow increased while the serum potassium and pH remained the same. It is suggested that localized hypoxia may result in cellular changes that release substances, e.g., potassium, to the interstitial space where they mobilize fluid and enhance lymph flow.
The transformation of inosine into 5'-inosine acid by Pseudomonas trifolii cells was studied. The synthesis of 5'-inosine acid can be performed by both live intact and dry cells. The effectiveness of inosine phosphorylation depends on the ratio of the inosine and phosphate donor concentrations and the amount of cells. The temperature and pH effect on activity of nucleoside phosphotransferase, phosphomonoesterase and 5'-nucleotidase has been studied. The influence of surface active substances and metal ions on the synthesis of 5'-inosine acid has been investigated. Optimal conditions for the inosine transformation by the above culture have been established.
The binding of 1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-(cyclohexyl)-1-nitrosourea (CCNU) to the proteins of the L1210 cell nucleus has been studied using both [cyclohexyl-14C]CCNU and [chloroethyl-14C]CCNU. Most of the bound [cyclohexyl-14C] moiety of CCNU was found to exist in a form that was stable in acid solution but labile and dialyzable in alkaline solution. A small amount of the cyclohexyl moiety was bound to histones in a stable, nondialyzable form. The drug/protein ratio for the H1 histone was about 0.01 to 0.02 mole/mole. No binding of the cyclohexyl group to acidic proteins or of the chloroethyl group to either histones or acidic proteins was observed. Thus, the interaction of CCNU with the proteins of the cell nucleus can be defined in terms of the modification of histones by the cyclohexyl moiety.
In addition to 8alpha-(N3-histidyl)riboflavin, 8alpha-(N1-histidyl)riboflavin is also formed during the reaction of Nalpha-blocked histidine with 8alpha-bromotetraacetylriboflavin in a yield of 20-25% of the total histidylflavin fraction. The properties of 8alpha-(N1-histidyl)riboflavin are inditical with those of the histidylflavin isolated from thiamine dehydrogenase and beta-cyclopiazonate oxidocyclase but differ from those of 8alpha-(N3-histidyl)riboflavin. These properties include pKa of fluorescence quenching, electrophoretic mobility at pH 5.0, stability to storage, and reduction by NaBH4. Proof for 8alpha substitution is shown by the electron paramagnetic resonance and electron-nuclear double resonance spectra of the cationic semiquinone form, as well as by the proton magnetic resonance spectrum of the oxidized form. The site of histidine substitution by the 8alpha-methylene of the flavin moiety was shown by methylation of the imidazole ring with methyl iodide, cleavage of the methylhistidine-flavin bond by acid hydrolysis at 150 degrees C, and identification of the methylhistidine isomer by electrophoresis. 3-Methylhistidine is the product from the N1-histidylflavin isomer, while 1-methylhistidine is produced from the N3 isomer. The flavin product from reductive Zn cleavage of either isomer has been identified as riboflavin. The compound obtained on acid treatment of 8alpha-(N3-histidyl)riboflavin (previously thought to be the N1 isomer) differs from the parent compound only in the ribityl side chain, since chemical degradation studies show 1-methylhistidine as a product and a flavin product which differs from riboflavin only in mobility in thin-layer chromatography, but not in absorption, fluorescence, and electron paramagnetic resonance spectral properties. Proof that acid modification involves only the ribityl chain has come from the observations that alkaline irradiation of this flavin yields lumiflavin, that the proton magnetic resonance spectrum of the compound differs from that of riboflavin in the region of the ribityl proton resonance, and that its periodate titer is lower than that of authentic riboflavin. The identity of 8alpha-(N1-histidyl)riboflavin with the histidylflavin from thiamine dehydrogenase and beta-cyclopiazonate oxidocyclase shows that both isomeric forms of 8alpha-histidylflavin occur in nature.
Forty paid healthy male students participated in two subacute experiments of 6 weeks each. In the first trial 20 of them received bromazepam, thioridazine, and placebo double blind cross over for 2 weeks each, and in the second trial the active agents administered to the other 20 participants were chlorpromazine and sulpiride. The tests used were paired associate learning with nonsense syllables and digit memory span. Before testing the subjects took either an alcoholic or a nonalcoholic bitter drink. As in the previous study from this laboratory, alcohol was found to impair learning capacity. Of the drugs used only bromazepam impaired learning significantly, and the combined effect of alcohol and bromazepam on learning capacity was very deleterious. The adrenolytic effect of drugs did not correlate with their effect on learning. Caution is necessary when prescribing bromazepam for active outpatients at least in doses used in this study.
From testing a new benzodiazepine derivative, 8-chloro-1-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-1,5-benzodiazepin-2-one (Bu 1014), as measured against a placebo in a double-blind trial, the following conclusions can be drawn. The test was carried out over two periods of a fortnight each with a change-over between the two periods. 1. The change-over method has proven suitable to reveal side effects of the substance which last for at least two weeks. Owing to the substance's sequelae, however, statistical analysis of the second treatment period's information is not possible with this experimental design. 2. The statistical methods used proved more effective than the usual methods as they allow clearer statements to be made on the efficacy of the substance. 3. Within the first period of 14 days both the group receiving the placebo and the drug treated group showed a decrease in the intensity of anxiety. 4. The sequelae of Bu 1014 can be described as an increase in restiveness and anxiety in those patients who received the placebo in the second treatment period.
The interaction between alpha-elastin and a connective tissue proteoglycan was followed by optical density measurements and circular dichroism spectroscopy. It was found that interaction takes place at pH values below the isoelectric point of elastin with the formation of a complex coacervate. CD spectra demonstrated conformational changes of alpha-elastin caused by the interaction and resulting in an increase in the content of helical structure. This finding suggests the possibility of the involvement of proteoglycans in the molecular organization of elastin.
The authors report the results of a series of investigations on the toxic effects produced in mice and rabbits by inhalation of Dimethyl-ether. Median lethal concentration (LC50) and Median lethal time (LT50) were determined in the mouse. Also the effects of DME inhalation on some physiological parameters (blood pressure, heart rate, blood gas and pH data) were evaluated in the rabbit.
Membranes of the bacterial form and the stable and unstable L-forms of Proteus mirabilis contain LD and DD-carboxypeptidase. The DD-carboxypeptidase is inhibited non-competitively by penicillin G. The enzyme of the bacterial form is highly penicillin-sensitive (Ki - 4 X 10(-9) M penicillin G). Inhibition is only partly reversible by treatment with penicillinase or by dialysis against buffer. In contrast, the DD-carboxypeptidase of the unstable L-form, grown in the presence of penicillin, is 175-fold less penicillin-sensitive (Ki = 7 X 10(7) M penicillin G). Inhibition is completely reversed by penicillinase or dialysis. After inhibition by penicillin and subsequent reactivation the penicillin sensitivity of the bacterial DD-carboxtpeptidase is similar to the sensitivity of the enzyme of the unstable L-form. The hypothesis is proposed that P. mirabilis contains two DD-carboxypeptidases of different penicillin sensitivity and with different mechanisms of penicillin binding. Peptidoglycan synthesis in the cell walls of the unstable L-form is probably carried out with the help of only one DD-carboxypeptidase, viz. the completely reactivatable enzyme with the lower penicillin sensitivity.
1. Chronic administration of glucose or nicotinamide in drinking water inhibits the activity of rat liver tryptophan pyrrolase, and subsequent withdrawal causes an enhancement. The enzyme activity is also inhibited by administration in drinking water of sucrose, but not fructose, which is capable of preventing the glucose effect. 2. The inhibition by glucose or nictinamide is not due to a defective apoenzyme synthesis nor a decreased cofactor availability. 3. The inhibition by nicotinamide is reversed by regeneration of liver NAD+ and NADP+ in vivo by administration of fructose, pyruvate or phenazine methosulphate. Inhibition by glucose is also reversed by the above agents and by NH4Cl. Reversal of inhibition by glucose or nicotinamide is also achieved in vitro by addition of NAD+ or NADP+. 4. Glucose or nicotinamide increases liver [NADPH]. [NADP+] is also increased by nicotinamide. [NADPH] is also increased by sucrose, but not by fructose, which prevents the glucose effect. Phenazine methosulphate prevents the increase in [NADPH] caused by both glucose and nicotinamide. 5. It is suggested that the inhibition of tryptophan pyrrolase activity by glucose or nicotinamide is mediated by both NADPH and NADH.
New colorimetric procedure for determination of bromisoval and carbromal is based on the hydroxamation reaction and colour developing after addition of Fe(ClO4)3. The method is employed for the estimation of both compounds in substances and in tablets.
The cell envelope of Sporillum sp. strain "Ordal" (possibly a variety of S. anulus) demonstrated multiple superficial wall layers which were diverse in their macromolecular arrays. Negative staining and freeze-etching techniques revealed an outer hexagonally packed layer and an inner tetragonally packed layer. However, both thin sections and freeze-etched cleavages of the wall showed that each of these regular structures rested upon a backing layer, and that there was a delicate amorphous layer overlying the outer hexagonal array. Rotary integration, optical deffraction, and reconstruction of image were used to clarify measurements of each array and to verify the validity of a diagrammatic model of the outer hexagonal system. The integrity of these layers required suitable cations (Ca2+ appeared essential) and pH (pH less than or equal to 4.6 dissociated most superficial layers). These observations aided in the development of a low-pH cationic-substitution technique, in which Na+ replaced essential Ca2+, for extraction of the layers from the cell surface. Dialysis to remove Na+ and restoration of Ca2+ initiated in vitro reassembly of the superficial layer components until regularly structured assembly products were formed.
Experiments were conducted on male rats. A study was made of the content of nicotinamide coenzymes in the liver and myocardium 24 hours after the administration of 0.5 ml of dichloroethane into the stomach. In parallel with disturbance of the morphological structure of the liver and of the myocardium, increase in the activity of alanine and aspargic aminotranspherases in the blood serum, dichloroethane reduced the content of nicotinamide coenzymes and deranged the ratio of their oxidized and reduced forms in these organs.
Ethylenediamine tetraacetate and mechanical treatment were applied to obtain the isolated hepatocytes. Oxidative phosphorylation was found to be preserved in the isolated cells. Hepatocytes were capable of hydroxylation of dimethylaniline (DMA), ethylmorphine and aminopyrine. VMAX for the hydroxylation of DMA calculated as per 1 nmol of the cytochrome P--450 was higher in the cells than in the microsomes. NADH formed during the oxidation of glutamate and malate can be used for hydroxylation.
A repressible alkaline phosphatase has been isolated from the extreme bacterial thermophile, Thermus aquaticus. The enzyme can be derepressed more than 1,000-fold by starving the cells for phosphate. In derepressed cells, nearly 6% of the total protein in a cell-free enzyme preparation is alkaline phosphatase. The enzyme was purified to homogeneity as judged by disc acrylamide electrophoresis and sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis. By sucrose gradient centrifugation it was established that the enzyme has an approximate molecular weight of 143,000 and consists of three subunits, each with a molecular weight of 51,000. Tris buffer stimulates the activity of the enzyme, which has a pH optimum of 9.2. The enzyme has a broad temperature range with an optimum of 75-80 degrees. The enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of a wide variety of phosphorylated compounds as do many of the mesophilic alkaline phosphatases. The Michaelis constant(Km) for the enzyme is 8.0 X 10(-4) M. Amino acid analysis of the protein revealed little in the amino acid composition to separate it from other mesophilic enzymes which have been previously studied.
Conditioning of reclaimed water with minerals and trace elements by means of filters made of silver-plated natural minerals containing calcium, magnesium, fluoride and iodine ions has been investigated. On the basis of the investigations a complex filter made of silver plated minerals--dolomite and fluorite--has been developed. This filter allows simultaneous mineralization and decontamination of reclaimed water and preparation of biologically complete potable water.
The metabolic fate of gaseous nitrogen (15N2) fixed by free-living cultures of Rhizobia (root nodule bacteria) induced for their N2-fixation system was followed. A majority of the fixed 15N2 was found to be exported into the cell supernatant. For example, as much as 94% of the 15N2 fixed by Rhizobium japonicum (soybean symbiont) was recovered as 15NH+4 from the cell supernatant following alkaline diffusion. Several species of root nodule bacteria also exported large quantities of NH+4 from L-histidine. Evidence is presented that overproduction and export of NH+4 by free-living Rhizobia may be closely linked to the control of several key enzymes of NH+4 assimilation. For instance, NH+4 was found to repress glutamine synthetase whereas L-glutamate repressed glutamate synthase. Assimilation of NH+4 as nitrogen source for growth of Rhizobia was inhibited by glutamate. The mechanism of regulation of NH+4 production by root nodule bacteria is discussed.
The intensity of light scattering from suspensions of membrane fragments prepared by sonication of beef heart mitochondria in the presence of EDTA at alkaline pH (ESMP) was determined at 45, 90, and 135 degrees with light of wavelength 546 nm. The dissymmetry ratio Z = I45 degrees c/I135 degrees c, where I45 degrees c and I135 degrees c are the scattering intensities at 45 and 135 degrees extrapolated to zero particle concentration and corrected for reflectance effects, was used to calculate particle size from the Rayleigh-Gans-Debye theory. An average particle diameter D of 184-190 nm was obtained, within the range of particle diameter 50-300 nm determined previously by electron microscopy. This average diameter determined by light scattering is a useful parameter for characterization of ESMP particle size. We propose the term: light scattering average particle diameter, DLS, for this parameter. The refractive index of ESMP was determined to be 1.443 by measurement of scattering intensity in buffer solutions of varying sucrose concentration. The value of Z was independent of sucrose concentration in this determination, showing that the particles are osmotically inactive toward sucrose. The values of average particle diameter DLS and of refractive index fall within the range of validity of the Rayleigh-Gans-Debye theory, for which light scattering changes are attributable solely to dimension change, rather than to change in particle refractive index. Uptake of water accompanying energy-linked salt uptake in ESMP was calculated from light scattering changes to be 0.18 mul of H2O/mg of protein, compared with 0.49 mul of H2O/mg of protein measured by dextran inaccessibility. Measurement of light scattering changes provides a rapid and sensitive method for determining volume changes of ESMP. The magnitude of the volume change observed during energy-linked water and salt uptake and the initial degree of hydration suggests that ESMP are analogous to polyelectrolyte gels with regard to sorption of strong electrolytes and that the Donnan formulation for ion exchange equilibria may be usefully applied to these processes in ESMP.
Changes in liver tyrosine aminotransferase induction were measured in mice after repeated or prolonged stressing. In the repeated chloroform stress variant the first impulse determines the amplitude of TAT induction; the second stress can only produce superinduction if repeated 40 minutes after the onset of the first one. In the prolonged irradiation stress variant the response was dependent on both the dose rate and duration of irradiation.
Gel filtration of supernatant fluids, from the wild-type Clostridium perfringens, strain CN3870, and several of the mutants and reverants derived from this strain, showed that these mutants failed to product detectable amounts of still produced sialidase III activity. The reverants tested had regained the ability to produce approximately wild-type levels of the I and II forms of both activities. These results showthat there is a direct relationship between the production of the I form and hemagglutinin and sialidase activities and the production of the II form of these biologically active proteins. Models that explain the genetic basis for these results are discussed.
The effect of attitudes of therapists, patients and researchers on the conduct and outcome of combined drug and psychotherapy research was examined in a brief crisis-oriented psychotherapy clinic. Seventy-seven consecutive patients were given one of two anti-anxiety drugs or a placebo in conjunction with the typical psychoanalytically-oriented treatment used in the clinic. The therapists' attitudes favouring psychotherapy over drug therapy (and psychotherapy research) were clearly conveyed to the patients. Indicative of this are the following: (a) 82 per cent of the patients dropped out of drug taking, although a similar percentage remained in treatment; (b) only a third of the patients perceived it as being important to their therapists that they should take medication; (c) 87 per cent of the patients were rated as improved; and 75 per cent of patients completing forms considered that most or all of their improvement was attributable to talking. The research team, made up of members of the same department who therefore had similar values as the therapists, diligently collected outcome data, but ignored its responsibility to enforce drug-relation portions of the protocol. Overall, patients remained in therapy, improved and participated in completing forms, so that only the research goals of combined therapy were thwarted, while traditional clinic service and training goals proceeded as usual.
Urinary acid excretion was measured in 35 human renal allograft recipients during the first few days after the onset of diuresis and two months after transplantation. In 16 out of 17 rejection episodes an early significant decrease of renal total net H+ excretion was observed. This urinary acidification impairment preceded the serum creatinine increase. Only few patients showed variations in blood pH and C1-. The acidification defect may be due to the ischaemic changes of rejection. Early impairment of urinary acidification supports a clinical diagnosis of rejection.
Mice from 12 inbred strains were surveyed for variation of kidney and liver arylsulfatase levels. Kidney variation was due to differences in the activity of arylsulfatase B. Twofold higher activities of arylsulfatase B in SWR/J kidney compared to A/HeJ kidney were determined by an autosomal gene which may be identical to the structural gene for arylsulfatase B since the SWR/J enzyme was more heat-stable than the A/HeJ enzyme. C57BL/6J mice possessed two-fold higher liver arylsulfatase levels than did A/HeJ mice. The major portion of this variation could be attributed to differences in arylsulfatase B, and appeared to be inherited in autosomal fashion. Although some evidence supports the existence of a major locus influencing liver arylsulfatase activity, this must be substantiated by further studies. Whatever the nature of the genetic factors involved, they do not appear to involve structural genes since no differences were discernible between the enzymes of the two strains relevant to Km, heat stability, electrophoretic mobility, pH optimum, activation energy, or response to several inhibitors. Furthermore, the rank ordering of strains on the basis of kidney arylsulfatase activity differed markedly from that which pertained to liver activity. Kidney arylsulfatase levels, but not brain or liver arylsulfatase activities, appear subject to androgenic influences.
The acetylenic substrate, D-2-amino-4-pentynoic acid (D-propargylglycine), was oxidatively deaminated by hog kidney D-amino acid oxidase[EC 1.4.3.3], with accompanying inactivation of the enzyme. The flavin which was extracted by hot methanol from the inactivated enzyme was identical with authentic FAD by thin-layer chromatography and circular dichroism. The excitation spectrum of emission at 520 nm of the released flavin was very similar to the absorption spectrum of oxidized FAD. The released flavin was reduced by potassium borohydride. The apoenzyme prepared after propargylglycine treatment did not show restored D-amino acid oxidase activity on adding exogenous FAD. The absorption spectrum of this inactivated apoenzyme showed absorption peaks at 279 and 317 nm, and a shoulder at about 290 nm. These results strongly indicate that the inactivation reaction is a dynamic affinity labeling with D-propargylglycine which produces irreversible inactivation of the enzyme by a covalent modification of an amino acid residue at the active site.
The stability of frozen solutions of cefazolin sodium was investigated in nine commonly used diluents at concentrations of 1 g with 2.5 ml, 500 mg with 100 ml and 10 g with 45 ml in both glass and polyvinylchloride plastic containers. The diluents were: Water for Injection USP; 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection USP; 5% Dextrose Injection USP (D5W); D5W with 0.02% sodium bicarbonate; D5W in Lactated Ringer's Injection USP; Lactated Ringer's Injection USP; Ionosol B in D5W; Normasol M in D5W; and Plasmalyte in D5W. Frozen cefazolin sodium solutions, containing Water for Injection USP, 5% Dextrose Inection USP or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection USP as the diluents, retained more than 90% of labeled potency for up to 26 weeks when frozen within one hour after reconstitution and held at -10 C or -20 C. Frozen cefazolin sodium solutions, made with other diluents, were stable for up to four weeks when frozen within one hour after reconstitution and held at -10 C.
ATPase activity of myosin in the heart muscle of the mouse, rat, guinea-pig, rabbit and pig was studied at neutral pH and under mild alkaline conditions. At neutral pH the ATPase activity of myosin is inversely related to body size of the animal species. The decrease of ATPase activity of myosin after alkaline preincubation depends on the degree of ATPase activity of intact myosin, i.e. myosin from the heart of the mouse exhibits high ATPase activity ae same relationship was found, when comparing myosin of new-born and adult heart muscle. It is concluded that the rate of alkaline inactivation of heart myosin is directly related to the degree of ATPase activity of intact myosin in all animals.
A sensitive and specific thin-layer chromatographic method for the simultaneous determination of acebutolol [DL-1-(2-acetyl-4-n-butyramidophenoxy)-2-hydroxy-3-isopropylaminopropane] and its major metabolite [DL-1-(2-acetyl-4-acetamidophenoxy)-2-hydroxy-3-isopropylaminopropane] is described. A 2-ml volume of serum with 350 ng of quinidine as internal standard was extracted at pH 10, the solvent was evaporated off and the residue was dissolved in 50 mul of methanol. A 10-mul volume of the solution was spotted on a thin-layer plate and after elution (ethyl acetate-methanol-ammonia, 75:20:5) the plate was dried at 90 for 15 min and, after cooling, dipped in a 10% paraffin wax solution. The fluorescence was measured using a spectrofluorimeter with a thin-layer scanning attachment. The peak-height ratios of acebutolol to internal standard and metabolite to internal standard were used to quantitate acebutolol and the metabolite, respectively.
Many eyes donated for use in corneal grafting are rejected because of signs of autolysis in the donor material. The purpose of this experimental study was to determine whether hydrocortisone acting as a lysosome membrane stabilizer could prevent or retard autolysis of the corneas under storage, and if so, what was the most efficacious concentration. Different groups of rabbit corneas were placed in saline as controls or in varying concentrations of hydrocortisone (10(-10) M to 10(-4) M at pH 7.4) at 37 degrees C and 4 degrees C. Acid phosphatase released after six hours was measured biochemically. This enzyme was used as a marker enzyme reflecting lysosomal labilization. Results showed a significant stabilization of the lysosomal membrane at 4 degrees C as compared to 37 degrees C. A trend towards stabilization of the lysosomal membrane was seen when 10(-8) M concentration of hydrocortisone at 37 degrees C was used, there being no demonstrable stabilization at 4 degrees C.
Histology of 10 certified and 5 possible cases of nonspecific aortoarteriitis (Takayasu's disease) is described. The lesions are not specific. They consist of diffuse or focal chronic inflammatory infiltrates in media and adventita. Granulomas with or without central coagulation necrosis may occur. Media and adventitia show a marked fibrous hyperplasia. The elastic fibers are destroyed. The intima is thickened by a fibrous proliferation. Secondary arteriosclerosis is frequently observed. Perforated or dissecting aneurysms due to the chronic inflammation of the aortic wall may occur. The abdominal aorta is most frequently affected, but any section of the aortic wall may be involved. Takayasu's disease is not rare in our area. Contrary to most of the tropical countries, females do not predominate among our patients and aged persons may be affected, too. Etiology is unknown, the affection probably belongs to the autoimmune diseases. The histologic differentiation from other inflammatory vascular diseases and even from a resorptive inflammation due to a perforated or dissected aneurysm may be extremely difficult.
In a double-blind triple cross-over clinical study, 37 patients were exposed to several formulations of mafenide acetate (Sulfamylon Cream) and their pain responses were recorded and converted to a semiquantitative pain index. The 11.2% concentration in cream was two to three times more painful than the 5% concentration. Hypertonicity  and not the pH level appears to be the cause of the pain produced by the high (11.2%) concentration. The tonicity of the cream carrier and 11.2% mafenide acetate are 1,080 mOsm/kg and 1,100 mOsm/kg, respectively, for a total of 2,180 mOsm/kg. The carrier cream without glycerol and a 5% concentration of mafenide cream were much less painful than the 11.2% concentration of mafenide. Both afforded a great deal of relief to the patients who received the medications.
Aspirin-induced gastritis and gastrointestinal hemorrhage were reviewed and discussed on the basis of currently available literature. Acute hemorrhagic gastritis occurs in from 50% to 70% of all patients taking aspirin, is not directly related to dose size, and can be severe enough to cause death in a few cases. No tolerance appears to ever develop. The mechanism that causes this bleeding is not definite, but the back diffusion of H+ ions accross the gastric barrier seems to bear primary responsibility, with physical erosion, prolonged platelet bleeding, and the effect of low pH values also being possible explanations. There appears to be less acid present in the stomach when bleeding occurs, but this is a masking effect of the aspirin that causes increased absorption of the H+ ions. Factors important in determining pharmaceutical formulation are method of administration, particle size of the aspirin, duration of contact between the drug and the mucosa, presence of buffers in the drug to raise the gastric pH, dissolution rate of the drug in the stomach, and ionization characteristics of the drug itself. Gastrointestinal blood loss caused by aspirin can be minimized by administering the drug in one of these forms:--a dilute solution of acetylsalicylate;--an intravenously injected solution;--a very rapidly dissolving and rapidly absorbed tablet;--a solution with sufficiently large amounts of antacid added;--a fine-grain, highly buffered aspirin tablet;--an enteric-coated tablet that does not dissolve in the stomach; or--an aspirin substitute such as acetaminophen.
Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase was activated by incubation with CO2 and Mg2++, and inactivated upon removal of CO2 and Mg2+ by gel filtration. The activation process involved CO2 rather than HCO3-. The activity of the enzyme was dependent upon the preincubation concentrations of CO2 and Mg2+ and upon the preincubation pH, indicating that activation involved the reversible formation of an equilibrium complex of enzyme-CO2-Mg. The initial rate of activation was linearly dependent upon the CO2 concentration but independent of the Mg2+ concentration. Kinetic analyses indicated that the enzyme reacted first with CO2 in a rate-determining and reversible step, followed by a rapid reaction with Mg2+ to form an active ternary complex (see eq 1 in text). The pseudo-first order rate constant, kobsd, for the activation process at constant pH was derived: kobsd=k1[CO2] + (k2k4/k3[Mg2+]). Experimentally, kobsd was shown to be linearly dependent upon the CO2 concentration and inversely dependent upon the Mg2+ concentration. The activity of the enzyme after preincubation to equilibrium at constant concentrations of CO2 and Mg2+ increased as the preincubation pH was raised, indicating that CO2 reacted with an enzyme group whose pK was distinctly alkaline. It is proposed that the activation of ribulose-1, 5-biphosphate carboxylane involves the formation of a carbamate.
The conditions for splitting protodioscine--the main steroid saponine isolated from Tribulus terrestris L. by the enzymic preparation of Aspergillus niger str. BKMt-33 were investigated. The optimal conditions were found to be as follows: pH 4-5, temperature 30-37 degrees (the substrate concentration--5 mg%, concentration of the enzymic preparation--1%). Under these conditions the enzymolysis continued 24 hours. Mg+2 and K+ ions accelerated the reaction twice. As a result of the enzymic hydrolysis dioscine and trilline were obtained. This indicates beta-glucosidase and alpha-rhamnosidase activities of the enzymic complex isolated from Aspergillus niger str. BKMt-33.
Acid-thermostable ribonucleases were isolated from human pancreas, duodenal contents, liver, spleen, serum and urine, and purified 15--1000-fold. The pH optima, ionic requirements, and some of the specificity requirements, of these enzymes were investigated. The isolated enzymes formed two distinct groups: (a) The ribonucleases of the pancreas, duodenal contents and fraction A of serum and urine exhibit a pH optimum of 8.5, are inhibited by An2+ and Cu2+, and relatively rapidly hydrolyze the synthetic substrate uridine 3'-(alpha-naphthylphosphate); (b) the ribonucleases of the liver and spleen, and of fractions B of the serum and urine, with a pH optimum of 7, are less sensitive to An2+ and Cu2+, and exhibit negligible activity versus uridine 3'-(alpha-naphthylphosphate). Determination of the serum level of pancreatic-type ribonuclease activity, with the use of uridine 3'-(alpha-naphthylphosphate) or RNA as substrates, appears to be a valid diagnostic tool for pancreatic fibrosis in children.
2-Chloroacetyl phenothiazines were reacted with certain phenols and salts of some acids under different conditions to yield 2-substituted acetylphenothiazines. Another series of 10-substituted phenothiazines was synthesized by treatment of 10-chloroacetylphenothiazine with either the appropriate amines or salts of the respective acids. The optimum experimental conditions for the preparation of 2-chloroacetyl-10-acetyl-phenothiazine by Friedel-Crafts reaction were studied. Also N-chloroacetyl-o-aminophenol was synthesized in high yield by a simple method. The preliminary pharmacological screening showed that two of these compounds possess a low order of tranquillizing activity.
Using a closed chamber microelectrode system, the tear pH levels of sixteen subjects were monitored throughout the waking extent of five days. In addition to the absolute mean pH differences found among subjects, diurnal patterns of pH change could be identified for the majority. The amplitudes and periods of these cycloid patterns, however, were distinctive to each individual. Also, tear pH levels following periods of prolonged eye closure were found to be notably more acid than those associated with the waking hours.
It has been demonstrated with an in vitro model that hemoperfusion through Amberlite XAD4 or coated charcoal containing cartridges eliminates carbromal and its ureid derivatives more efficiently than hemodialysis. The following clearancs were measured in vitro (blood flow: 200 ml/min): Coil dialyser (1 m2): 55-85 ml/min, charcoal hemoperfusion 100-125 ml/min, Amberlite XAD4 hemoperfusion: 200 ml/min. The data of one patient who had been hemoperfused after the ingestion of 35 g Carbromal with the Haemocol cartridge (SMith & Nephews) are depicted. Our results permit to draw the conclusion that hemoperfusion at this time is the most efficient means to eliminate Carbromal from intoxicated patients.
The influence of aging on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system was evaluated by comparing young (20 to 30 yr) with elderly (62 to 70 yr) healthy subjects. Despite comparable body sodium-fluid balance in the two age groups, serum renin concentration, plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentrations were lower in the elderly. The age-related decreases in circulating renin and aldosterone concentrations were slight while subjects were supine and receiving normal sodium intake; when upright and during sodium depletion, they were more pronounced. Inverse renin-blood pressure interrelations were noted during two of four study conditions involving normal sodium intake or mild sodium depletion (r = --0.44 and --0.47, respectively), but not during progressive sodium depletion. Plasma renin levels were decreased in the elderly regardless of the presence or absence of an inverse relationship with blood pressure. Aldosterone and cortisol responses to corticotropin infusion were unaltered in the elderly. It is concluded that aging may cause a decrease in circulating renin, with parallel lowering of plasma aldosterone concentrations.
Using a food-reinforced two-lever operant procedure, rats (n=6) were trained to discriminate fentanyl (1.25 mg/kg, p.o., t-60') from solvent (1 ml/100 g B.W., p.o., t-60'). The administration of another narcotic analgesic (pethidine) produced a dose-related generalization with the standard fentanyl treatment; six non-narcotic analygesics (suprofen, acetylsalicylic acid, indomethacin, phenacetin, phenylbutazone, tolmetin) were found not to do so. It is concluded that the ability of drugs to produce analgesia is not a sufficient condition for the drugs to produce the narcotic cue as well.
Addition of the cell soluble supernatant fraction to an assay medium containing NADPH generating system, mixed function oxidase substrate and microsomes, resulted in a stimulation of drug metabolism ranging from 12-75%. This stimulation was observed only when the supply of DADPH generating system (isocitric dehydrogenase or glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase) was insufficient, leading to a NADPH oxidation rate which was greater than the rate of reduction of NADP+ during the oxidation of a drug. Hence, under our assay conditions, the soluble supernate (SS) is only providing sufficient NADPH generator, and possibly relieving inhibition by the generated NADP+. Finally, microsomal lipid peroxidation measurements under these same conditions indicate negligible to no peroxidation activity in the absence of SS.
Examples are given of interactions between foods and drugs, some of which may on occasion produce adverse effects. Such interactions are not as frequent and rarely as significant as interactions between drugs, which have become of increasing interest and importance.
The effects of manual compression of the upper lateral abdomen (C) of 73 cases of obstructive airway disease were studied in respect to the change in minute ventilation (V) 10 minutes after the procedure was performed. A mean decrease of 13% in V was found in the majority of 15 cases of bronchial asthma or chronic bronchitis and 43 patients with chronic obstructive lung disease. The use of manual compression as a therapeutic measure depends largely on the abrupt reduction of lung volume in cases of obstructive airway disease in which over-inflation of the lung is present as an acute or chronic disorder. The degree and duration of clinical benefit, i.e., relief of dyspnea, depends on such factors as the volume of air trapped in the lungs, broncho-constriction through pathologic change or bronchospasm and impairment of elastic recoil of the pulmonary parenchyma. The lowered V recorded 10 minutes after C is performed suggests that decrease in dyspnea is associated with enhanced efficiency of ventilation in some subjects with obstructive airway disease, including those with bronchial asthma as well as COLD. A brief description is presented of 10 patients with COLD in whom manual compression and other features of a rehabilitation program were employed. Mean length of life of five living subjects is 12.6 years after beginning of therapy. The mean length of life of five who died was 10.2 years after beginning of treatment.
Escherichia coli generation in the logarithmic growth phase was inhibited in peptone broth USP at pH 7.0 without kill below 3.0 mug/ml of aminosidine. Above this value, the logarithms of the number of viables of the drug-treated culture ultimately decreased linearly with time and the slopes of these plots were independent of concentration. A concentration-dependent lag in the time of attainment of the cidal action was observed, and the extent of this lag was related to the ease of emergence of resistant organisms. The minimal concentration for cidal action increased with increasing concentrations of nutrients and with decreasing pH. Pretreatment of the cultures with novobiocin and tetracycline lessened the minimum bactericidal concentration of aminosidine whereas chloramphenicol pretreatment increased it. Tetracycline pretreatment inhibited the emergence of aminosidine-resistant organisms.
An acute form of trypanosomiasis (course of disease 4 to 8 days) was produced in mice experimentally infected with a strain of T. vivax. The features of the disease were: a parasitemia which appeared to increase exponentially from 23.8 to 243.6 times 10(6) trypanosomes per ml within the last 24 hours of the disease; anaemia was not severe in the disease in mice; the basic histological lesion was generalized fibrin thrombus formation in the blood vessels of the heart, lung, spleen and brain; trypanosome enboli were present in the brain, spleen and liver of infected mice. The disease in mice could prove a useful model in studies of the pathogenesis of acute trypanosomiasis and also in studies in the mechanism of generalized intravascular coagulation.
Experiments carried out to examine the effects of nicotine and "tar" on the extent of and subjective reactions to cigarette smoking. It was confirmed that smokers rate commercial, low-nicotine cigarettes as less "strong" and less "satisfying" than their usual brands. Since such cigarettes deliver reduced amounts of tar as well as of nicotine, an experiment to distinguish between the two was carried out with special cigarettes. Ratings of "strength" were directly related to nicotine but were not affected by tar. The numbers of cigarettes smoked fell slightly as their estimated delivery of nicotine increased, but tar had no effect on this index. The urinary excretion of nicotine was correlated with the rated yields of nicotine for the different cigarettes, but there was also evidence that subjects tended to adjust their manner of smoking so as to titrate their doses of nicotine. The results are interpreted as indicating a role for nicotine, but not for tar, in the maintenance of cigarette smoking behavior, and as support for the view that less harmful cigarettes should have a high yield of nicotine relative to tar.
Cerebral metabolism in 21 hydrocephalic patients was studied. Preoperative and postoperative specimens of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were obtained and the cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) was calculated in each instance. The specimens of CSF were analyzed for lactate and pyruvate and the lactate/pyruvate (L/P) ratio was calculated for each sample. The L/P ratio, which reflects the redox state of the cell, was used to determine the extent of anaerobic metabolism. An inverse relationship was noted between CPP and lactate as well as the L/P ratio. In general, the level of anaerobic metabolism was decreased after insertion of a shunt.
