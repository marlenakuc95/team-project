The B-cell -type specificity of the immunoglobulin ( Ig ) heavy-chain and light-chain promoters is mediated by an octanucleotide ( OCTA ) element , ATGCAAAT , that is also a functional component of other RNA polymerase II promoters , such as snRNA and histone H2B promoters .	0 7 0 0 0 0 9 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

NF-A1 is present in a variety of cell types , whereas the presence of NF-A2 is essentially confined to B cells , leading to the hypothesis that NF-A2 activates cell-type-specific transcription of the Ig promoter and NF-A1 mediates the other responses of the OCTA element .	9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 7 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0

This suggests that the constitutive OCTA-binding factor NF-A1 can activate transcription of the Ig promoter and that B-cell -specific transcription of this promoter , at least in vitro , is partially due to a quantitative difference in the amount of OCTA-binding protein .	0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0
Because NF-A1 can stimulate Ig transcription , the inability of this factor to activate in vivo the Ig promoter to the same degree as the snRNA promoters probably reflects a difference in the context of the OCTA element in these two types of promoters .	0 9 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 0

Using the 1G5 cell line harbouring the luciferase reporter gene under the control of the HIV-1 LTR , it was first found that culture protein filtrates ( CFP ) from M. tuberculosis or purified ManLAM could activate HIV-1 LTR-dependent gene expression unlike similarly prepared CFP extracts devoid of ManLAM .	0 0 5 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

To gain a better understanding of the impact of long terminal repeat ( LTR ) sequence diversity on LTR-directed gene expression in cells of the central nervous system ( CNS ) and immune system , we amplified and cloned LTRs from proviral DNA in HIV-1-infected peripheral blood .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Transient expression analyses in cells of neuroglial and lymphocytic origin demonstrated that some of these LTRs had activities which varied significantly from the LAI LTR in U-373 MG cells ( an astrocytoma cell line ) as well as in Jurkat cells ( a CD4-positive lymphocyte cell line ) .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 5 6 6 0 0 5 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 5 6 0 0 5 6 6 6 0 0

In particular , naturally occurring sequence variation impacted transcription factor binding to an activating transcription factor / cAMP response element binding ( ATF / CREB ) binding site ( located between the LEF-1 and distal NF-kappaB transcription factor binding sites ) that we identified in previous studies of the HIV-1 LTR .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 0 0 9 10 10 0 9 10 10 10 0 9 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0

Among several known transcription factor binding motifs , nuclear protein ( s ) of VD3-treated HL-60 cells and THP-1 cells bound to the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein ( C/EBP ) -binding motif that was located in the upstream region of the MRP14 gene ( -81 ) , as evidenced by the competitive gel mobility-shift assay .	0 0 0 1 2 2 2 0 9 10 10 10 10 0 5 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
An antibody for C/EBP alpha super-shifted the nucleoprotein complex in THP-1 cells but not in the VD3-treated HL-60 cells , whereas an antibody for C/EBP beta blocked the formation of the complex with the nuclear factor of the HL-60 cells but not with that of THP-1 cells .	0 0 0 9 10 0 0 9 10 0 5 6 0 0 0 0 5 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 0 5 6 0 0 0 0 0 5 6 0

By using purified human erythroid colony-forming cells ( ECFC ) , we have found that SCF and EPO synergistically activate MAP kinase ( MAPK , ERK1/2 ) , which correlates with the cell growth and thus may be responsible for the synergistic effects .	0 0 5 6 6 6 6 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 9 0 0 9 10 0 9 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

We have previously shown that binding of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) virions to CD4 receptors stimulates association of Lck with Raf-1 and results in the activation of Raf-1 kinase in a Ras-independent manner .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 0 0 9 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0
In the present study , we demonstrate that HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins of both T-cell-tropic and macrophagetropic strains rapidly activate the ERK/mitogen-activated protein ( MAP ) kinase pathway and the binding of nuclear transcription factors ( AP-1 , NF-kappaB , and C/EBP ) and stimulate expression of cytokine and chemokine genes .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 0 9 0 9 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 2 0

We have investigated this syndrome for the possibility of abnormal Type I or `` mineralocorticoid-like '' receptors , which have intrinsic steroid specificity indistinguishable from that of renal mineralocorticoid receptors and are found in many tissues and cells , including mononuclear leukocytes .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 0 9 10 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 7 8 0
We have studied three patients with pseudohypoaldosteronism : the 28-year-old index case in Melbourne ( Patient 1 ) and two siblings in Munich , eight and two years of age ( Patients 2 and 3 ) ; clinically , Patient 3 had a less severe case than his sister .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Evolution of a case of chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) into blast crisis was found to be characterized by three unusual features ( 1 ) the phenotype of the emerging blast cells was that of pre-plasmacytoid cells as shown by plasma cell morphology and an immunological phenotype corresponding partially with CLL- or intermediate B-cells , partially with plasma cells ( terminal transferase - , common acute lymphocytic leukemia antigen - , Ia+ , surface immunoglobulin heavy chains - , surface kappa light chains + , intracytoplasmic immunoglobulin A+ and G+ , BA-1+ , polyclonal gammaglobulin production ) ; ( 2 ) cytogenetic analysis of spontaneous metaphases revealed that in addition to the typical CLL abnormality , trisomy 12 , in all of the cells , an additional translocation between chromosomes 14 and 17 was present in 40 % with a presumptive breakpoint on chromosome 14 ( q12-3 ) never described before ( commonly q32 ) and ( 3 ) the progression of the disease was associated with a striking increase in the expression by the transformed cells of specific binding sites for estradiol ( E2 ) due to an actual increase in total cellular receptor proteins and not to a change in receptor affinity for E2 .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 8 0 0 0 7 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 8 8 0 0 0 7 8 0 9 10 0 0 0 9 10 10 10 0 0 9 0 9 10 10 10 0 0 9 10 10 10 0 0 9 10 10 10 10 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Defects in actin-cap formation in Vav-deficient mice implicate an actin requirement for lymphocyte signal transduction .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Although actin polymerization is known to be required , the mechanisms underlying cap formation are unclear .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
We have studied the events underlying cap formation using mice bearing a null mutation in vav ( vav -/- ) , a gene that encodes a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor for the GTPase Rac .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 0 0 9 10 0
RESULTS : Lymphocytes from vav -/- mice failed to form T-cell receptor caps following activation and had a defective actin cytoskeleton .	0 0 7 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The vav-/- T cells were deficient in interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) production and proliferation , and the peak of Ca2+ mobilization was reduced although of normal duration .	0 7 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Activation of Jun N-terminal kinase or stress-activated kinase ( JNK or SAPK ) and mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) and the induction of the transcription factor NF-ATc1 and egr-1 genes was normal .	0 0 9 10 10 0 9 10 0 9 0 9 0 0 9 10 10 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 1 2 2 2 0 0 0
Despite the reduced Ca2+ mobilization , translocation of cytoplasmic NF-ATc to the nucleus was normal , reflecting that the lower levels of Ca2+ in vav-/- cells were still sufficient to activate calcineurin .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 0 0 0 0 0 9 0
Treatment of lymphocytes with cytochalasin D , which blocks actin polymerization , inhibited cap formation and produced defects in signaling and IL-2 transcriptional induction in response to antigen-receptor signaling that were nearly identical to those seen in vav-/- cells .	0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 0

CD14 -dependent activation of human endothelial cells by Bacteroides fragilis outer membrane .	9 0 0 0 7 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0
We studied the capacity of isolated Bacteriodes fragilis outer membrane , B. fragilis NCTC9343 lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ; endotoxin ) , and B. fragilis NCTC9343 capsular polysaccharides to activate human umbilical vein endothelial cell ( HUVEC ) monolayers .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
To assess HUVEC activation , E-selectin expression was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) , Northern blot analysis for E-selectin-specific mRNA , and electrophoretic gel mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) for NF-kappa B , a transcription factor necessary for E-selectin gene activation .	0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 0 9 10 0 0 1 2 0 0
Exposure of HUVECs to B. fragilis outer membrane fractions , separated from other components of the B. fragilis cell wall by isopycnic , sucrose gradient centrifugation , significantly increased surface expression of E-selectin and induced functional endothelial cell -dependent leukocyte adhesion .	0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 7 8 0 0 0 0

In contrast , E-selectin expression induced by outer membrane fractions purified from E. coli was competitively inhibited by polymixin B .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Neither purified B. fragilis LPS , a prominent constituent of the outer membrane , nor purified B. fragilis capsular polysaccharides induced HUVEC activation .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Two different monoclonal antibodies directed against human CD14 completely inhibited B. fragilis outer membrane-induced NF-kappa B activation , E-selectin transcription , and E-selectin surface expression .	0 0 9 10 0 0 9 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
We conclude that the outer membrane component of the B. fragilis cell wall contains a proinflammatory factor ( s ) , that is not LPS , which induces human endothelial cell activation by a soluble CD14 -dependent mechanism .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 8 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0

In the present study , we sought to investigate whether constitutive NF-kappaB activity in chronically HIV-1-infected promonocytic U937 ( U9-IIIB ) and myeloblastic PLB-985 ( PLB-IIIB ) cells affects apoptotic signaling .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 5 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0

Inhibition of TNFalpha -induced NF-kappaB activation using the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) resulted in increased apoptosis in both U937 and U9-IIIB cells , while preactivation of NF-kappaB with the non-apoptotic inducer IL-1beta caused a relative decrease in apoptosis .	0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 9 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Inhibition of constitutive NF-kappaB activity in U9-IIIB and PLB-IIIB cells also induced apoptosis , suggesting that NF-kappaB protects cells from a persistent apoptotic signal .	0 0 0 9 0 0 5 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0
TNFalpha plus NAC treatment resulted in a marked decrease in Bcl-2 protein levels in HIV-1-infected cells , coupled with an increase in Bax protein compared to uninfected cells , suggesting that the difference in susceptibility to TNFalpha -induced apoptosis may relate to the differences in relative levels of Bcl-2 and Bax .	9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 0 7 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 9 0
The protective role of NF-kappaB in blocking TNFalpha- and HIV-1-induced apoptosis was supported by studies in Jurkat T cells engineered to express IkappaB alpha repressor mutants ( TD-IkappaB ) under the control of a tetracycline-responsive promoter .	0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 6 6 0 0 0 9 10 10 10 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0
Cells underwent apoptosis in response to TNFalpha only when NF-kappaB activation was inhibited by TD-IkappaB expression .	0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0
As was observed for the U9-IIIB cells , TNFalpha treatment also induced a marked decrease in Bcl-2 protein levels in TD-IkappaB expressing cells .	0 0 0 0 0 5 6 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 0 7 8 8 0
These experiments demonstrate that apoptotic signaling is perturbed in HIV-1-infected U9-IIIB cells and indicate that NF-kappaB activation may play an additional protective role against HIV-1-induced apoptosis in myeloid cells .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 0

The heterodimeric Ku protein , which comprises a 86 kDa ( Ku86 ) amd a 70 kDa ( Ku70 ) subunits , is an abundant nuclear DNA-binding protein which binds in vitro to DNA termini without sequence specificity .	0 0 9 10 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 10 10 0 0 9 10 10 10 10 10 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0

Although the heterodimer Ku70/variant-Ku86 binds to DNA-ends , this altered form of the Ku heterodimer has a decreased ability to recruit the catalytic component of the complex , DNA-PK ( CS ) , which contributes to an absence of detectable DNA-PK activity in B cells .	0 0 9 10 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 0

The molecular pathways that regulate T cell quiescence remain largely unknown .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Here we show that forced expression of the lung Kruppel-like transcription factor ( LKLF ) in Jurkat T cells is sufficient to program a quiescent phenotype characterized by decreased proliferation , reduced cell size and protein synthesis and decreased surface expression of activation markers .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 10 0 9 0 0 5 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Conversely , LKLF-deficient peripheral T cells produced by gene targeting showed increased proliferation , increased cell size and enhanced expression of surface activation markers in vivo .	0 0 7 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

HTLV-1 p12 ( I ) protein enhances STAT5 activation and decreases the interleukin-2 requirement for proliferation of primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells .	9 10 10 10 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 7 8 8 8 8 8 0
The p12 ( I ) protein , encoded by the pX open reading frame I of the human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) , is a hydrophobic protein that localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi .	0 9 10 10 10 10 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Although p12 ( I ) contains 4 minimal proline-rich , src homology 3-binding motifs ( PXXP ) , a characteristic commonly found in proteins involved in signaling pathways , it has not been known whether p12 ( I ) has a role in modulating intracellular signaling pathways .	0 9 10 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 10 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
This study demonstrated that p12 ( I ) binds to the cytoplasmic domain of the interleukin-2 receptor ( IL-2R ) beta chain that is involved in the recruitment of the Jak1 and Jak3 kinases .	0 0 0 0 9 10 10 10 0 0 0 9 10 0 0 9 10 10 10 10 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 10 0
As a result of this interaction , p12 ( I ) increases signal transducers and activators of transcription 5 ( STAT5 ) DNA binding and transcriptional activity and this effect depends on the presence of both IL-2R beta and gamma ( c ) chains and Jak3 .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 10 0 9 10 10 10 10 10 10 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 0 9 0
Transduction of primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) with a human immunodeficiency virus type 1-based retroviral vector expressing p12 ( I ) also resulted in increased STAT5 phosphorylation and DNA binding .	0 0 5 6 6 6 6 6 0 7 0 0 0 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 9 10 10 10 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0
However , p12 ( I ) could increase proliferation of human PBMCs only after stimulation of T-cell receptors by treatment of cells with low concentrations of alphaCD3 and alphaCD28 antibodies .	0 0 9 10 10 10 0 0 0 0 7 8 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 10 0

Together , these data indicate that p12 ( I ) may confer a proliferative advantage on HTLV-1-infected cells in the presence of suboptimal antigen stimulation and that this event may account for the clonal proliferation of infected T cells in vivo .	0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 8 0 0 0

Critical downregulatory role of IL-4 .	0 0 0 0 9 0
Interleukin ( IL ) -18 has been well characterized as a costimulatory factor for the induction of IL-12-mediated interferon ( IFN ) -gamma production by T helper ( Th ) 1 cells , but also can induce IL-4 production and thus facilitate the differentiation of Th2 cells .	9 10 10 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 10 10 10 0 0 7 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 0
To determine the mechanisms by which IL-18 might regulate these diametrically distinct immune responses , we have analyzed the role of cytokines in the regulation of IL-18 receptor alpha chain ( IL-18Ralpha ) expression .	0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 10 0 9 0 0 0
The majority of peripheral CD4 ( + ) T cells constitutively expressed the IL-18Ralpha .	0 0 0 7 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 9 0
Upon antigen stimulation in the presence of IL-12 , marked enhancement of IL-18Ralpha expression was observed .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0
IL-12 -mediated upregulation of IL-18Ralpha required IFN-gamma .	9 0 0 0 9 0 9 0
Activated CD4 ( + ) T cells that expressed low levels of IL-18Ralpha could produce IFN-gamma when stimulated with the combination of IL-12 and IL-18 , while CD4 ( + ) cells which expressed high levels of IL-18Ralpha could respond to IL-18 alone .	7 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 9 0 0 7 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 9 0 0
In contrast , T cell stimulation in the presence of IL-4 resulted in a downregulation of IL-18Ralpha expression .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0
Both IL-4 ( -/ ) - and signal transducer and activator of transcription ( Stat ) 6 ( -/ ) - T cells expressed higher levels of IL-18Ralpha after TCR stimulation .	0 7 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0

Thus , positive/negative regulation of the IL-18Ralpha by the major inductive cytokines ( IL-12 and IL-4 ) determines the capacity of IL-18 to polarize an immune response .	0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 9 0 9 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0

GR acts as a direct inhibitor of NF-kappa B-induced HAT activity and also by recruiting HDAC2 to the NF-kappa B/HAT complex .	9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 9 10 10 0
A sub-group of patients with glucocorticoid-insensitive asthma have an inability to induce histone acetylation in response to dexamethasone suggesting reduced expression of a GR-specific HAT .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0

Galectin-10 ( gal-10 , also known as Charcot-Leyden crystal protein ) is a member of the galectin family of beta-galactoside binding proteins that is expressed uniquely in eosinophilic and basophilic leukocytes .	9 0 9 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 9 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 8 8 0

The decrease in gal-10 promoter activity after disruption of either the GC box ( -44 to -50 ) or the Oct site ( -255 to -261 ) suggests that these sites , along with the previously characterized GATA and EoTF sites , are necessary for full promoter activity .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Adipophilin is a sensitive marker for lipid loading in human blood monocytes .	9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 8 0
Adipophilin , a marker of lipid accumulation initially described in adipocytes , was recently shown to be induced in macrophage foam cells .	9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 8 0
We found that even freshly isolated blood monocytes express adipophilin and that the amount of adipophilin protein is variable in monocytes from different healthy individuals .	0 0 0 0 7 8 8 8 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0
However , the physiological expression of adipophilin does not correlate with the levels of free fatty acids , cholesterylesters or free cholesterol .	0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Enzymatically modified low-density lipoprotein ( E-LDL ) induces rapid foam cell formation in monocytes and upregulates adipophilin mRNA and protein within 2 h of incubation .	9 10 10 10 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
This rapid induction of adipophilin is accompanied by a significant increase of free fatty acids in monocytes incubated with E-LDL .	0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 9 0
Adipophilin facilitates the uptake of free fatty acids , and here we demonstrate that free fatty acids increase is related to the early upregulation of adipophilin expression in blood monocytes .	9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 0
Fatty acids are ligands for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma ( PPARgamma ) , and the upregulation of adipophilin mRNA by PPARgamma agonists like 15d-PGJ ( 2 ) and ciglitazone indicates that PPARgamma may mediate the induction of adipophilin expression in human blood monocytes .	0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 4 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 8 0

In melanoma cell lines , two different patterns of MHC class II expression have been described , either an IFN gamma-inducible expression of HLA-DR and HLA-DP , with a faint or null expression of HLA-DQ , resembling that described for melanocytes , or a constitutive expression , i.e. , IFN-gamma independent , of all three HLA-D isotypes .	0 5 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0
As this latter phenotype has been associated with a more rapid progression of melanoma tumors , we have analyzed in different melanoma cell lines the molecular mechanisms leading to this abnormal pattern of MHC class II expression .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
In agreement with the evidence of a coordinate transcription of the HLA-D genes in these cell lines , we have shown the constitutive expression of CIITA ( class II transactivator ) transcripts , CIITA being known as the master switch of MHC class II expression .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

In distinction to drug-free maturing dendritic cells , 2.5 micromol/L sulfasalazine upregulated the levels of CD14 and CD68 and downregulated the levels of CD40 , CD80 , and CD83 ( for all CD markers , p < 0.03 for difference between measurements in the absence and the presence of sulfasalazine ) .	0 0 0 0 0 7 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 9 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
From concentration-dependent changes in CD83 expression , we found an apparent ID50 > > 1.5 micromol/L sulfasalazine .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

At 1.25 micromol/L , sulfasalazine largely inhibited NF-kB activation in dendritic cells .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 0

OBJECTIVE : Thrombopoietin ( TPO ) and transforming growth factor-beta ( 1 ) ( TGF-beta ( 1 ) ) have been shown to exert opposite effects on proliferation and megakaryocytic differentiation of hematopoietic cells .	0 0 9 0 9 0 0 9 10 10 10 10 10 0 9 10 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 0
To determine whether TGF-beta ( 1 ) interferes directly with TPO -induced signal transduction in hematopoietic cells , we compared the regulatory effects in the TPO -responsive cell lines Mo-7e and HEL .	0 0 0 9 10 10 10 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 7 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
MATERIALS AND METHODS : The cells were stimulated by 100 ng/mL TPO and/or 100 ng/mL TGF-beta1 and analyzed for proliferation ( 3H thymidine incorporation ) , viability ( trypan blue exclusion ) , and protein expression and phosphorylation ( Western blot ) .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
RESULTS : TPO enhanced the proliferation of Mo-7e cells as determined by 3H-thymidine incorporation , whereas TGF-beta1 suppressed baseline cell growth and antagonized the proliferative effect of TPO .	0 0 9 0 0 0 0 5 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0
TPO -induced proliferation also was reduced by a specific inhibitor of the mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) pathway ( PD098059 ) , which inhibits activation of the MAPK extracellular signal-regulated kinases ( ERK ) ERK1 and ERK2 , and AG490 , an inhibitor of Janus kinase-2 , which completely blocked TPO -induced proliferation .	9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 10 0 9 0 9 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0
As demonstrated by Western blotting , TGF-beta1 reduced the TPO -stimulated ERK1 / ERK2 and STAT5 phosphorylation in Mo-7e and HEL cells .	0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 9 0 9 0 9 0 0 0 0 5 6 6 6 0
This effect was completely reversed by preincubation with a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor ( Na3VO4 ) , which suggests that TGF-beta1 activated a phosphatase .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 9 0
Although STAT3 also was activated by TPO , STAT3 activation remained unaltered by TGF-beta1 .	0 9 0 0 0 0 9 0 9 0 0 0 0 9 0
CONCLUSION : Taken together , these data suggest that TGF-beta1 modulates TPO -mediated effects on megakaryocytic proliferation by interfering with TPO -induced signal transduction , particularly by reducing the activities of MAPK ERK1/ERK2 and STAT5 .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 10 0

Early stages of B cell development occur in the bone marrow , resulting in formation of immature B cells .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 8 0

Recently , invariant chain ( Ii ) , a major histocompatibility complex class II chaperone , as well as the transcription factors c-Rel and p65/RelA , were found to play a role in the final antigen-independent differentiation stage of B cells in the spleen .	0 0 9 10 0 9 0 0 0 9 10 10 10 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 9 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 0 0 0 0

It is known that glucocorticoids ( GC ) , used for treatment of AID , increase apoptosis in the thymus resulting in decreased numbers of CD4+ CD8+ thymocytes .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 8 0
It was asked whether androgens , in contrast to oestrogens , exert their favourable effects in the treatment of AID by a mechanism comparable to that described for GC by eliminating the apoptosis prone CD4+ CD8+ population in the thymus .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 8 0 0 0 0
Although both androgens and oestrogens proved thymolytic , a significantly decreased percentage of CD4+ CD8+ thymocytes was observed by flow cytometry after treatment of mice with the androgen methyltestosterone , but not with the oestrogen ethinylestradiol .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
To investigate whether the observed thymolytic effects were due to the presence of hormone receptors on thymocytes , cells were isolated from the thymus and incubated with androgens or oestrogens to measure apoptosis .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Several techniques were used to determine thymocyte apoptosis in vitro , but no enhanced apoptotic signal was observed .	0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Using the very sensitive TUNEL assay , no direct effect of androgens on thymocytes in vitro could be observed .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0
This is in sharp contrast to the high signal observed with GC .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Therefore , upon in vivo androgen treatment , other cells containing androgen receptors than thymocytes are probably involved in inducing the increase in thymic apoptosis .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
To study the role of the androgen receptor on thymocyte apoptosis , androgen receptor mutant ( Tfm/Y ) mice were treated with androgens .	0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 7 0 0 9 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
No alterations of thymocyte subpopulations were seen , suggesting that changes in the percentage of CD4+ CD8+ thymocytes after administration of androgens depend on the presence of functional androgen receptors .	0 0 0 7 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0

Functional correction of FA-C cells with FANCC suppresses the expression of interferon gamma-inducible genes .	0 0 0 7 8 0 9 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 0
Because hematopoietic cells derived from Fanconi anemia ( FA ) patients of the C-complementation group ( FA-C ) are hypersensitive to the inhibitory effects of interferon gamma ( IFNgamma ) , the products of certain IFNgamma-inducible genes known to influence hematopoietic cell survival were quantified .	0 7 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
High constitutive expression of the IFNgamma-inducible genes , IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 gamma subunit ( ISGF3gamma ) , IFN regulatory factor-1 ( IRF-1 ) , and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 ( WAF1 ) was found in FANCC mutant B lymphoblasts , low-density bone marrow cells , and murine embryonic fibroblasts .	0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 9 10 10 10 10 10 0 9 0 0 9 10 10 0 9 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 10 0 9 0 0 0 0 9 0 7 8 0 7 8 8 8 0 0 7 8 8 0

In an attempt to clarify mechanisms by which FA-C cells overexpress IFNgamma-inducible genes in the face of defective STAT1 phosphorylation , it was reasoned that decreased levels of activated STAT1 might result in reduced expression of a hematopoietic IFNgamma-responsive protein that normally modulates expression of other IFNgamma-responsive genes .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0

Thus , the FANCC protein functions to modulate expression of a family of genes that in normal cells are inducible only by specific environmental cues for apoptosis or mitogenic inhibition , but it does so independently of the classic IFN-STAT1 pathway and is not the direct result of reduced ICSBP expression .	0 0 0 9 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0

MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS : LPS increased the lung leak index , the neutrophils and NO levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid , and NO levels produced by resting and stimulated alveolar macrophages .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 0

Recent studies in transgenic mice have revealed that expression of a dominant negative form of the transcription factor GATA-3 in T cells can prevent T helper cell type 2 ( Th2 ) -mediated allergic airway inflammation in mice .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 0 7 8 0 0 7 8 8 8 8 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
However , it remains unclear whether GATA-3 plays a role in the effector phase of allergic airway inflammation and whether antagonizing the expression and/or function of GATA-3 can be used for the therapy of allergic airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness .	0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Here , we analyzed the effects of locally antagonizing GATA-3 function in a murine model of asthma .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
We could suppress GATA-3 expression in interleukin ( IL ) -4 -producing T cells in vitro and in vivo by an antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotide overlapping the translation start site of GATA-3 , whereas nonsense control oligonucleotides were virtually inactive .	0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 10 10 0 7 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
In a murine model of asthma associated with allergic pulmonary inflammation and hyperresponsiveness in ovalbumin ( OVA ) -sensitized mice , local intranasal administration of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled GATA-3 antisense oligonucleotides led to DNA uptake in lung cells associated with a reduction of intracellular GATA-3 expression .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Furthermore , treatment with antisense but not nonsense oligonucleotides induced a significant reduction of airway hyperresponsiveness in OVA-sensitized mice to levels comparable to saline-treated control mice , as assessed by both enhanced pause ( PenH ) responses and pulmonary resistance determined by body plethysmography .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
These data indicate a critical role for GATA-3 in the effector phase of a murine asthma model and suggest that local delivery of GATA-3 antisense oligonucleotides may be a novel approach for the treatment of airway hyperresponsiveness such as in asthma .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

METHODS AND RESULTS : BALB/c mice , making a CD4+ Th2 ( IL-4+ ) cell response , express both MHC class II antigens ( IA ( d ) , IE ( d ) ) and are atherosclerosis-resistant .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 10 0 9 10 10 10 0 9 10 10 10 0 0 0 0 0

To evaluate T helper-cell phenotype in fatty streak formation , wild-type C57Bl/6 mice ( IA ( b ) +IE- ) and transgenic mice , either AB ( o ) , IA ( b ) -IE- ; ABEalpha , IA-IE ( k ) + ; or BL : TG : Ealpha , IA ( b ) +IE ( k ) + , were fed a high-cholesterol diet for 16 weeks and evaluated histomorphometrically for aortic lesions .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Lesion size in AB ( o ) , ABEalpha , and BL : TG : Ealpha strains was decreased by 54 % , 79 % , and 82 % , respectively , compared with wild-type , correlating with decreased Th1 and increased Th2 expression and suggesting that T helper-cell phenotype is important in fatty lesion development .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Immunohistology revealed IFN-gamma , but not IL-4 , colocalized with activated macrophages .	0 0 9 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 7 0
Confirming these findings in a different mouse strain , BALB/c Stat 6 knockout mice ( Th2 cell-deficient ) developed aortic lesions comparable to C57Bl/6 mice on the same diet .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
CONCLUSIONS : In mildly hypercholesterolemic C57Bl/6 mice , presence of IA ( b ) and absence of IE regulated CD4+ T helper-cell phenotype ; fatty lesions were proportional to IFNgamma+ Th1 cells in both C57Bl/6 and BALB/c strains .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 10 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

However , the precise intracellular signaling pathways involved have not been elucidated .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
We demonstrate here that human serum albumin modified with N ( varepsilon ) - ( carboxymethyl ) lysine ( CML ) , a major AGE adduct that progressively accumulates with aging , diabetes , and renal failure , induced nuclear factor ( NF ) -kappaB -driven reporter gene expression in human monocytic THP-1 cells .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 10 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 8 8 0
The NF-kappaB response was blocked with a synthetic peptide corresponding to the putative ligand-binding domain of RAGE , with anti- RAGE antiserum , and by coexpression of truncated receptors lacking the intracellular domain .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 0 9 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 0 9 10 0

Activation of NF-kappaB by CML-modified albumin increased secretion of proinflammatory cytokines ( tumor necrosis factor-alpha , interleukin-1beta , and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 ) severalfold , and inhibition of p38 MAPK blocked these increases .	0 0 9 0 9 10 0 0 0 9 10 0 9 10 10 0 9 0 0 9 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 0 0 0

Although the immediate-early proteins of both herpes simplex virus ( HSV ) and cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) are known to modify promyelocytic leukemia ( PML ) ( ND10 ) bodies in the nucleus of the host cell , it has been unclear whether lytic infection with gamma herpesviruses induces a similar effect .	0 0 9 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Although the inhibitors prevented both pervanadate-induced phosphorylation of I kappa B-alpha on Tyr42 and NF-kappa B activation , we observed that , in p56 ( lck ) -deficient Jurkat mutants , NF-kappa B could still associate with I kappa B-alpha despite phosphorylation on Tyr42 .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 0 0 0 9 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 9 10 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 0 0 0 0 0

RESULTS : Consistent with the known features of nasal polyps , CD4+ ( T helper/inducer ) , CD8+ ( cytotoxic/suppressor ) , CD68+ ( macrophages ) , mast cells , eosinophils and neutrophils were all clearly detected by their relevant monoclonal antibodies or appropriate histochemical staining , but only mast cells tested positive for ER /PR labelling with their polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 8 8 8 0 7 8 8 8 0 7 0 7 0 0 7 8 0 7 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 10 0

The expression of ER / PR was independent of patient sex and age but was highly correlated with the numbers of mast cells ( r = 0.973 , p < 0.001 for ER ; r = 0.955 , p < 0.001 for PR ) .	0 0 0 9 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0

NF kappa b signaling in posthypoxic endothelial cells : relevance to E-selectin expression and neutrophil adhesion .	0 0 0 0 0 7 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Our previous studies have implicated the nuclear transcription factor kappa B ( NF kappa B ) in the regulation of adhesion molecule expression in endothelial cells exposed to anoxia-reoxygenation ( A/R ) or a redox imbalance .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 0 7 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The objectives of this study were ( 1 ) to define the kinetics of NF kappa B activation by examining I kappa B alpha degradation and the nuclear translocation of p65 in response to A/R or redox imbalance ( induced by treatment of cells with diamide and buthionine sulfoximine ) and ( 2 ) to determine whether the signal for I kappa B alpha degradation , nuclear translocation of p65 , and E-selectin -mediated neutrophil adhesion is related to the activity of protein tyrosine kinase ( PTK ) , protein tyrosine phosphatase ( PTPase ) and/or protein kinase C ( PKC ) .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 0 9 0 0 9 10 10 0 9 0 0 9 10 10 0 9 0 0
The results demonstrate that both A/R and redox imbalance led to I kappa B alpha degradation within 30 min and the concomitant appearance of p65 in the nucleus , consistent with rapid cytosolic activation of NF kappa B and subsequent nuclear translocation of the activated p65 subunit .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 0
Inhibition of PKC blocked I kappa B alpha degradation and p65 translocation in A/R-challenged , but not redox-altered , endothelial cells .	0 0 9 0 9 10 10 10 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 0
However , both A/R- and redox-induced NF kappa B activation was blocked by inhibition of PTK .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0
Similarly , A/R-induced E-selectin expression and neutrophil-endothelial cell adhesion were blocked by inhibition of PKC or PTK , while only PTK inhibited the redox-induced adhesion response .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 9 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0
Pretreatment of cells with N-acetyl cysteine effectively blocked A/R- or redox-induced I kappa B degradation and significantly attenuated the respective neutrophil adhesion responses .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Collectively , these findings indicate that A/R-induced E-selectin expression and neutrophil-endothelial cell adhesion are mediated by both PKC and PTK , which signal rapid activation of NF kappa B .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 0
This A/R-induced NF kappa B signaling response appears to be mediated , at least in part , by intracellular redox imbalance .	0 0 9 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Dimethylammonium salt of 2 , 4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid ( DMA-2 , 4-D ) is a widely used herbicide that is considered moderately toxic .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Apoptosis induced by DMA-2 , 4-D was dose and time dependent , independent of Fas , TNF receptor 1 or the aromatic hydrocarbon receptor , and involved disruption of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential and activation of caspase-9 .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 9 10 10 0 0 9 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0

While an inhibitor of caspase-9 , as well as caspase-9 and caspase-3 inhibitors in combination , strongly blocked DMA-2 , 4-D-induced apoptosis , an inhibitor of caspase-3 had a moderate inhibitory effect .	0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0

Transfection of Jurkat cells with Bcl-2 prevented DMA-2 , 4-D-induced disruption of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential and led to a complete blockage of apoptosis .	0 0 5 6 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

The activation of caspases occurs downstream of mitochondrial damage , and the dysfunction of mitochondria appears to be sufficient for triggering all downstream events leading to apoptosis .	0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Inhibition of Th1 differentiation by IL-6 is mediated by SOCS1 .	0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 9 0
Interleukin 6 ( IL-6 ) is a cytokine produced by immune and nonimmune cells and exhibits functional pleiotropy and redundancy .	9 10 0 9 0 0 0 9 0 0 7 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
IL-6 plays an important role in the differentiation of several cell types .	9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

While IL-6 -directed CD4 + Th2 differentiation is mediated by IL-4 , inhibition of Th1 differentiation by IL-6 is independent of IL-4 .	0 9 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 9 0
IL-6 upregulates suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 ( SOCS1 ) expression in activated CD4+ T cells , thereby interfering with signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 ( STAT1 ) phosphorylation induced by interferon gamma ( IFNgamma ) .	9 0 9 10 10 10 10 0 9 0 0 0 7 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 10 10 10 10 0 9 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 9 0 0
Inhibition of IFNgamma receptor-mediated signals by IL-6 prevents autoregulation of IFNgamma gene expression by IFNgamma during CD4+ T cell activation , thereby preventing Th1 differentiation .	0 0 9 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 9 0 7 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Recent observations have shown two CCAAT/enhancer binding protein ( C/EBP ) binding sites to be critically important for efficient human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) replication within cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage , a cell type likely involved in transport of the virus to the brain .	0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Additionally , sequence variation at C/EBP site I , which lies immediately upstream of the distal nuclear factor kappa B site and immediately downstream of a binding site for activating transcription factor ( ATF ) / cyclic AMP response element binding protein ( CREB ) , has been shown to affect HIV-1 long terminal repeat ( LTR ) activity .	0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 0 9 0 0 9 10 10 10 10 10 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 2 0 1 0 0 0
Given that C/EBP proteins have been shown to interact with many other transcription factors including members of the ATF/CREB family , we proceeded to determine whether an adjacent ATF/CREB binding site could affect C/EBP protein binding to C/EBP site I .	0 0 9 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 0 0 9 10 0 0 1 2 2 0
Electrophoretic mobility shift analyses indicated that selected ATF/CREB site variants assisted in the recruitment of C/EBP proteins to an adjacent , naturally occurring , low-affinity C/EBP site .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0
This biophysical interaction appears to occur via at least two mechanisms .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
First , low amounts of CREB-1 and C/EBP appear to heterodimerize and bind to a site consisting of a half site from both the ATF/CREB and C/EBP binding sites .	0 0 0 0 0 9 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 2 2 0
In addition , CREB-1 homodimers bind to the ATF/CREB site and recruit C/EBP dimers to their cognate weak binding sites .	0 0 0 9 10 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 9 10 0 0 0 1 2 2 0
This interaction is reciprocal , since C/EBP dimer binding to a strong C/EBP site leads to enhanced CREB-1 recruitment to ATF/CREB sites that are weakly bound by CREB .	0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 9 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 9 0
Sequence variation at both C/EBP and ATF/CREB sites affects the molecular interactions involved in mediating both of these mechanisms .	0 0 0 0 1 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Most importantly , sequence variation at the ATF/CREB binding site affected basal LTR activity as well as LTR function following interleukin-6 stimulation , a treatment that leads to increases in C/EBP activation .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Selective inhibition of interleukin-4 gene expression in human T cells by aspirin .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 8 0 0 0

This study is the first in which concentrations of ASA in the therapeutic range were found to significantly reduce interleukin ( IL ) -4 secretion and RNA expression in freshly isolated and mitogen-primed human CD4+ T cells .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0
In contrast , ASA did not affect IL-13 , interferon-gamma , and IL-2 expression .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 9 0 0 9 0 0
ASA inhibited IL-4 , but not IL-2 , promoter-driven chloramphenicol acetyltransferase expression in transiently transfected Jurkat T cells .	0 0 9 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 6 6 0
The structurally unrelated nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs indomethacin and flurbiprofen did not affect cytokine gene expression in T cells , whereas the weak cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor salicylic acid was at least as effective as ASA in inhibiting IL-4 expression and promoter activity .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0
The inhibitory effect of ASA on IL-4 transcription was not mediated by decreased nuclear expression of the known salicylate target nuclear factor ( NF ) -kappaB and was accompanied by reduced binding of an inducible factor to an IL-4 promoter region upstream of , but not overlapping , the NF of activated T cells- and NF-kappaB-binding P1 element .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0
It is concluded that anti-inflammatory salicylates , by means of a previously unrecognized mechanism of action , can influence the nature of adaptive immune responses by selectively inhibiting the expression of IL-4 , a critical effector of these responses , in CD4+ T cells .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 8 0

In B6 mice , flow cytometry demonstrated an IL-1-dependent leukocyte infiltration into the synovial compartment and RNase protection assays revealed induction of messenger RNA ( mRNA ) for the chemokines monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 , macrophage inhibitory protein 2 ( MIP-2 ) , RANTES , MIP-1alpha , and MIP-1beta , in vivo and in vitro .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 4 0 3 0 0 0 9 9 10 10 10 0 9 10 10 10 0 9 0 0 9 0 9 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Positive and negative regulation of granulopoiesis by endogenous RARalpha .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0

However , although it is not absolutely required , RARalpha can bidirectionally modulate granulopoiesis .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0
RARalpha stimulates differentiation in response to exogenous retinoic acid .	9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Furthermore , endogenous retinoids control granulopoiesis in vivo , as either vitamin A-deficient mice or animals treated with an RAR antagonist accumulate more immature granulocytes in their bone marrow .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 0 0 0 0 0

Specific nongenomic effects occur within a few minutes and are mediated by steroid-selective membrane receptors .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 0

METHODS/RESULTS : Cells exposed to high D-glucose ( 30 mmol/l ) caused an increase in [ 3H ] -thymidine incorporation and cell numbers at 24 and 48 h and normalized at 72 h ( p < 0.05 ) , whereas these changes were not found in high mannitol ( 30 mmol/l ) , IL-1 beta , or TNF alpha -stimulated mesangial cells .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 0 9 10 0 7 8 0
Cells exposed to high-glucose ( 15 , 30 , or 60 mmol/l ) or osmotic agents ( L-glucose , raffinose and mannitol ) showed that intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression began to increase after 24 h , reached its maximum at 24 and 48 h and gradually decreased afterwards .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Results showed that high glucose ( 15 , 30 mmol/l ) or high concentrations of osmotic agents remarkably increased the number of adherent leukocytes to mesangial cells ( p < 0.01 ) compared with control cells ( 5 mmol/l D-glucose ) .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 7 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 0 0 0 0 0 0
Functional blocking of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 on mesangial cells with rat intercellular adhesion molecule-1 monoclonal antibody , calphostin C , staurosporine , or N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone significantly inhibited high glucose- or high mannitol-induced increase in leukocyte adhesion ( p < < 0.05 ) .	0 0 0 9 10 10 0 7 8 0 9 10 10 10 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION : These results suggest that high glucose can upregulate intercellular adhesion molecule-1 protein and mRNA expression but not vascular adhesion molecule-1 expression in mesangial cells and promote leukocyte adhesion through up-regulation of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 through osmotic effect , possibly depending on the protein kinase C nuclear factor-kappa B ( PKC - NF-kappa B ) pathway .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 9 10 10 0 9 0 9 10 0 0 0

Human eosinophils constitutively express nuclear factor of activated T cells p and c .	7 8 0 0 9 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 0

The expression of almost all of the cytokines produced by eosinophils , including the proallergic cytokine IL-4 , is now known to be regulated at the level of transcription by members of the nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) family of transcription factors .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 7 0 0 0 9 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 10 10 10 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0
OBJECTIVE : We sought to characterize the expression of different NFAT proteins in resting and activated eosinophils .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 7 8 8 8 0

RESULTS : Both peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid eosinophils expressed NFATp and NFATc protein .	0 0 0 7 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 9 10 10 10 0
Unlike activated T cells , which express multiple NFATc isoforms , eosinophils preferentially express the approximately 85-kd isoform .	0 7 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
In addition , eosinophils were found to constitutively express NFATc mRNA .	0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 3 4 0
A brief incubation with the T ( H ) 2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-5 was sufficient to induce the nuclear translocation of NFATc .	0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 10 10 10 9 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0
Eosinophil nuclear extracts contain multiple factors that can specifically recognize the IL-4 promoter P1 NFAT site in DNA-binding assays , including NFATp .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 9 0

The Nef protein of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) has been shown to enhance the infectivity of virus particles , downmodulate cell surface proteins , and associate with many intracellular proteins that are thought to facilitate HIV infection .	0 9 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

The Nef-ER is kept in an inactive state due to steric hindrance , and addition of the membrane-permeable drug 4-hydroxytamoxifen ( 4-HT ) , which binds to the ER domain , leads to inducible activation of Nef-ER within cells .	0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0
We demonstrate that Nef-ER inducibly associates with the 62-kDa Ser/Thr kinase and is localized to specific membrane microdomains ( lipid rafts ) only after activation .	0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Half-maximal downmodulation of cell surface CD4 required very little active Nef-ER and occurred as early as 4 h after addition of 4-HT .	0 0 0 9 10 10 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
In contrast , 50 % downmodulation of HLA-A2 by Nef required 16 to 24 h and about 50- to 100-fold-greater concentrations of 4-HT .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
These data suggest that HLA-A2 downmodulation may require certain threshold levels of active Nef .	0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0

The facts that PMN influx was preceded by increased MIP-2 mRNA expression , suggesting that MIP-2 is involved in the development of NaVO3-induced pulmonary inflammation , whereas increased MIP-1alpha mRNA expression was followed by decreased AMs in BAL cells , suggesting AMs might be activated by MIP-1alpha , adherent to the lining surface of the airways and then resistant to be washed out .	0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 4 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 7 8 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Bone resorption is regulated by the immune system , where T-cell expression of RANKL ( receptor activator of nuclear factor ( NF ) -kappaB ligand ) , a member of the tumour-necrosis factor family that is essential for osteoclastogenesis , may contribute to pathological conditions , such as autoimmune arthritis .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 9 0 9 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Stromal-derived factor 1 and thrombopoietin regulate distinct aspects of human megakaryopoiesis .	9 10 10 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The role of the chemokine binding stromal-derived factor 1 ( SDF-1 ) in normal human megakaryopoiesis at the cellular and molecular levels and its comparison with that of thrombopoietin ( TPO ) have not been determined .	0 0 0 0 9 0 9 10 10 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0

However , it does induce chemotaxis , trans-Matrigel migration , and secretion of matrix metalloproteinase 9 ( MMP-9 ) and vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) by these cells , and both SDF-1 and TPO increase the adhesion of alpha ( IIb ) beta ( 3 ) ( + ) cells to fibrinogen and vitronectin .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 9 0 0 9 10 10 10 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 9 0 0 0 0 7 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 9 0 9 0
Investigating the intracellular signaling pathways induced by SDF-1 and TPO revealed some overlapping patterns of protein phosphorylation/activation ( mitogen-activated protein kinase [ MAPK ] p42/44 , MAPK p38 , and AKT [ protein kinase B ] ) and some that were distinct for TPO ( eg , JAK-STAT ) and for SDF-1 ( eg , NF-kappa B ) .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 10 10 10 10 0 9 10 0 0 9 10 10 10 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 9 10 0 0
It was also found that though inhibition of phosphatidyl-inositol 3-kinase ( PI-3K ) by LY294002 in alpha ( IIb ) beta ( 3 ) ( + ) cells induced apoptosis and inhibited chemotaxis adhesion and the secretion of MMP-9 and VEGF , the inhibition of MAPK p42/44 ( by the MEK inhibitor U0126 ) had no effect on the survival , proliferation , and migration of these cells .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 9 0 0 0 0 7 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 9 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Hence , it is suggested that the proliferative effect of TPO is more related to activation of the JAK-STAT pathway ( unique to TPO ) , and the PI-3K-AKT axis is differentially involved in TPO- and SDF-1-dependent signaling .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Proteasome inhibitors impaired internalization of IL-2.IL-2R and prevented the lysosomal degradation of this cytokine .	0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0

Proteasome function was also necessary for the lysosomal degradation of IL-2 internalized by IL-2R that were comprised of cytoplasmic tailless beta- or gamma c-subunits , suggesting that the target protein for the proteasome is independent of either the cytoplasmic tail of the IL-2R beta- or gamma c-subunits and their associated signaling components .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 9 10 9 10 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 0 9 9 10 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 0
Therefore , a functional proteasome is required for optimal endocytosis of the IL-2R/ligand complex and is essential for the subsequent lysosomal degradation of IL-2 , possibly by regulating trafficking to the lysosome .	0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Although both isomers were expressed in human erythroid-megakaryocytic cell lines , megakaryocytic maturation with loss of erythroid phenotype induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) resulted in exclusive downregulation of fNF-E2 , suggesting that fNF-E2 promoter is more erythroid specific .	0 0 0 0 0 0 5 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0

Nevertheless , inhibitors of these pathways clearly reduced the TNF-alpha -induced cell growth , indicating that TNF- alpha-proliferative cells produced a growth factor that induced proliferation upon stimulation of the above pathways .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Transient expression of actively mutated Fyn , having Phe-528 instead of Tyr-528 or Thr-338 instead of Ile-338 , in Jurkat T-cells stimulated the serum response element ( SRE ) , 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate response element , cyclic AMP response element , and c-fos promoter .	0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 1 2 2 2 2 0 1 0 0 1 2 2 0 1 2 2 2 0 0 1 2 0

A novel NF-kappa B complex containing p65 homodimers : implications for transcriptional control at the level of subunit dimerization .	0 0 9 10 10 0 9 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The predominant inducible form of the NF-kappa B transcription factor is a heteromeric complex containing two Rel-related DNA-binding subunits , termed p65 and p50 .	0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 10 0 0 9 10 0 0 9 10 10 0 9 10 0 9 0
Prior transfection studies have shown that when these p65 and p50 subunits are expressed independently as stable homodimers , p65 stimulates kappa B-directed transcription , whereas p50 functions as a kappa B-specific repressor .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 10 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

As with the prototypical NF-kappa B p50-p65 heterodimer , this novel p65 homodimeric form of NF-kappa B is functionally sequestered in the cytoplasm but rapidly appears in the nuclear compartment following cellular stimulation .	0 0 0 0 9 10 10 10 0 0 0 9 10 10 0 9 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Site-directed mutagenesis studies indicate that the homodimerization function of p65 is dependent upon the presence of cysteine 216 and a conserved recognition motif for protein kinase A ( RRPS ; amino acids 273 to 276 ) , both of which reside within a 91-amino-acid segment of the Rel homology domain that mediates self-association .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 0 0 0 0

Egr-1 is an immediate early gene that is rapidly upregulated in response to mitogenic signals induced by antigen receptor crosslinking on murine B lymphocytes .	1 0 0 1 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 8 0

We compared the expression of Egr-1 during B cell stimulation with Fab'2 and IgG anti-immunoglobulin ( anti-Ig ) , since it is known that Fab'2 anti-Ig is mitogenic while IgG anti-Ig is not , owing to a dominant inhibitory effect of crosslinking the B cell Fc gamma RII to membrane Ig .	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 9 10 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 0 0 9 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 10 10 0 9 10 0
While mitogenic doses of Fab'2 anti-Ig induce large and rapid increases in Egr-1 expression , IgG anti-Ig results in smaller increases in Egr-1 mRNA , comparable to that seen with submitogenic concentrations of Fab'2 anti-Ig .	0 0 0 0 9 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 0 0 0 0 3 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0
However , the correlation between Egr-1 expression and B cell proliferation breaks down when IL-4 is added as a co-mitogen to induce B cell proliferation with IgG anti-Ig or submitogenic concentrations of Fab'2 anti-Ig .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 0 0 0 9 10 0

It is shown that LPS induced a 12- to 16-fold increase in IL-1 beta , IL-6 , and TNF-alpha mRNA levels , and this was completely or more than 80 % blocked by the protein tyrosine kinase specific inhibitors herbimycin A and genistein at the concentrations of 1.7 and 37 microM , respectively .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Inhibition of protein kinase A by H89 reduced IL-6 mRNA levels but did not detectably change IL-1 beta or TNF-alpha mRNA levels .	0 0 9 10 10 0 0 0 3 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

In addition to cytokine mRNA levels , LPS-induced IL-6 protein synthesis and IL-6 bioactivity were also reduced to baseline levels by the PTK inhibitors herbimycin A and genistein .	0 0 0 3 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Both PTK inhibitors also reduced the LPS activation of nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) , which is a transcription factor involved in the expression of cytokine genes such as IL-6 and TNF-alpha .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 0 9 10 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 0 0 0 0 3 4 0 0 1 0 1 0

In summary , these findings suggest that protein kinase C and protein kinase A appear to have selective effects in the LPS induction of cytokines , whereas PTK is required for LPS induction of a broad spectrum of cytokines and NF-kappa B activation in monocytes .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 0 9 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 9 10 0 0 7 0

Some liberated dimers were retained in the cytoplasm , however , through binding to newly synthesized I kappa B alpha , a finding which strongly suggests ( i ) that the LPS-induced signal causes dissociation of complexes rather than preventing their association and ( ii ) that dissociation results from modification of I kappa B alpha and not of c-rel or p65 .	0 9 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 10 0 0 0 9 0 9 0

Vitamin D receptor quantitation in human blood mononuclear cells in health and disease .	9 10 10 0 0 7 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0
Vitamin D receptor ( VDR ) concentration was quantitated in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) from patients with absorptive hypercalciuria ( AH ) and patients with high 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 due to acquired or transient disease states and the results compared to those in normal subjects .	9 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 8 8 8 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

The B-cell -type specificity of the immunoglobulin ( Ig ) heavy-chain and light-chain promoters is mediated by an octanucleotide ( OCTA ) element , ATGCAAAT , that is also a functional component of other RNA polymerase II promoters , such as snRNA and histone H2B promoters .	0 7 0 0 0 0 9 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

NF-A1 is present in a variety of cell types , whereas the presence of NF-A2 is essentially confined to B cells , leading to the hypothesis that NF-A2 activates cell-type-specific transcription of the Ig promoter and NF-A1 mediates the other responses of the OCTA element .	9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 7 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0

This suggests that the constitutive OCTA-binding factor NF-A1 can activate transcription of the Ig promoter and that B-cell -specific transcription of this promoter , at least in vitro , is partially due to a quantitative difference in the amount of OCTA-binding protein .	0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0
Because NF-A1 can stimulate Ig transcription , the inability of this factor to activate in vivo the Ig promoter to the same degree as the snRNA promoters probably reflects a difference in the context of the OCTA element in these two types of promoters .	0 9 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 0

Using the 1G5 cell line harbouring the luciferase reporter gene under the control of the HIV-1 LTR , it was first found that culture protein filtrates ( CFP ) from M. tuberculosis or purified ManLAM could activate HIV-1 LTR-dependent gene expression unlike similarly prepared CFP extracts devoid of ManLAM .	0 0 5 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

To gain a better understanding of the impact of long terminal repeat ( LTR ) sequence diversity on LTR-directed gene expression in cells of the central nervous system ( CNS ) and immune system , we amplified and cloned LTRs from proviral DNA in HIV-1-infected peripheral blood .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Sequence analysis of nineteen LTRs cloned from 2 adult and 3 pediatric patients revealed an average of 33 nucleotide changes ( with respect to the sequence of the LAI LTR ) within the 455-bp U3 region .	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 1 2 2 0
Transient expression analyses in cells of neuroglial and lymphocytic origin demonstrated that some of these LTRs had activities which varied significantly from the LAI LTR in U-373 MG cells ( an astrocytoma cell line ) as well as in Jurkat cells ( a CD4-positive lymphocyte cell line ) .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 5 6 6 0 0 5 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 5 6 0 0 5 6 6 6 0 0
While LTRs which demonstrated the highest activities in U-373 MG cells also yielded high activities in Jurkat cells , the LTRs were generally more active in Jurkat cells when compared to the LAI LTR .	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 5 6 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 5 6 0 0 0 0 1 2 0

In particular , naturally occurring sequence variation impacted transcription factor binding to an activating transcription factor / cAMP response element binding ( ATF / CREB ) binding site ( located between the LEF-1 and distal NF-kappaB transcription factor binding sites ) that we identified in previous studies of the HIV-1 LTR .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 0 0 9 10 10 0 9 10 10 10 0 9 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0

Among several known transcription factor binding motifs , nuclear protein ( s ) of VD3-treated HL-60 cells and THP-1 cells bound to the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein ( C/EBP ) -binding motif that was located in the upstream region of the MRP14 gene ( -81 ) , as evidenced by the competitive gel mobility-shift assay .	0 0 0 1 2 2 2 0 9 10 10 10 10 0 5 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
An antibody for C/EBP alpha super-shifted the nucleoprotein complex in THP-1 cells but not in the VD3-treated HL-60 cells , whereas an antibody for C/EBP beta blocked the formation of the complex with the nuclear factor of the HL-60 cells but not with that of THP-1 cells .	0 0 0 9 10 0 0 9 10 0 5 6 0 0 0 0 5 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 0 5 6 0 0 0 0 0 5 6 0

OBJECTIVE : Carrier identification in X-linked immunodeficiency disorders can be based on the demonstration of non-random X inactivation ( NRXI ) in affected blood cell lineages when growth is impaired in cells expressing the abnormal gene .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0
We examined the utility of seeking evidence of NRXI to test the carrier status of women in families affected by X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency ( XSCID ) and X-linked hypogammaglobulinaemia ( XLH ) , to identify as carriers the mothers of boys with SCID or hypogammaglobulinaemia whose phenotype suggested X-linkage and to infer X-linkage in boys with SCID or hypogammaglobulinaemia whose disease was not clearly X-linked on the basis either of family history or clinical and immunological characteristics .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Functional blocking of E-selectin , intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 , and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 on endothelial cells with the corresponding mouse mAb significantly inhibited glucose-induced increase in leukocyte adhesion ( 67+/-16 , 83+/-12 , 62+/-8 versus 144+/-21 cells/ mm2 ) .	0 0 0 9 0 9 10 10 10 0 0 9 10 10 10 0 7 8 0 0 0 9 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Binding of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 to CD4 and CXCR4 receptors differentially regulates expression of inflammatory genes and activates the MEK /ERK signaling pathway .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 10 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0
We have previously shown that binding of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) virions to CD4 receptors stimulates association of Lck with Raf-1 and results in the activation of Raf-1 kinase in a Ras-independent manner .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 0 0 9 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0
In the present study , we demonstrate that HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins of both T-cell-tropic and macrophagetropic strains rapidly activate the ERK/mitogen-activated protein ( MAP ) kinase pathway and the binding of nuclear transcription factors ( AP-1 , NF-kappaB , and C/EBP ) and stimulate expression of cytokine and chemokine genes .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 0 9 0 9 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 2 0

These results provide firm molecular evidence that binding of HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins to CD4 receptor initiates a signaling pathway ( s ) independent of the binding to the chemokine receptor that leads to the aberrant expression of inflammatory genes and may contribute significantly to HIV-1 replication as well as to deregulation of the immune system .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 0 9 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

This variability can not be explained by the known correlation between active cell proliferation and an increase in the number of receptors , since the tumors with the highest growth fraction ( i.e. , Burkitt 's lymphoma and T-cell leukemia ) tend to have lower average receptor numbers than do tumors with lower growth fractions such as common ALL .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

On the basis of in vitro models , it is proposed that perhaps the high receptor cell lines ( i.e. , common ALL of childhood ) have relative stability of their genetic material making glucocorticoid-resistant mutations less likely to occur in patients with these cells than in low-receptor cell lines ( i.e. , T-cell leukemia ) .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Structure and regulation of the glucocorticoid hormone receptor .	0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 0
The glucocorticoid receptor is an intracellular protein which possesses three distinct domains , one that binds agonist and antagonist steroids , one that binds DNA , and one that binds anti-receptor antibodies and is required for glucocorticoid modulation of gene expression .	0 9 10 0 0 9 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
In intact cells , receptor number , affinity and activity can change in response to factors that bind to the receptor , or that act indirectly through ill-defined mechanisms which may include resumption or arrest of cell cycling and variations in intracellular calcium ion concentrations .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Some of these factors appear to exert their effect by controlling critical receptor properties such as ATP-dependent phosphorylation , integrity of thiol groups , and exposure of key amino acid residues .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 10 0

At equilibrium , the solution for the equation delta G = delta H - T X delta S ( eqn. 1 ) was ( in kJ X mol-1 ) -47 = 36 - 83 ( dexamethasone ) and -42 = -9 - 33 ( cortisol ) at 0 degree C .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Enthalpy and entropy changes decreased quasi-linearly with temperature such that , at 25 degrees C , the respective values were -50 = -75 + 25 and -43 = -48 + 5 .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

For the forward reaction , eqn.

These data fit quite well with a two-step model [ Ross & Subramanian ( 1981 ) Biochemistry 20 , 3096-3102 ] proposed for ligand-protein interactions , which involves a partial immobilization of the reacting species governed by hydrophobic forces , followed by stabilization of the complex by short-range interactions .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Evolution of a case of chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) into blast crisis was found to be characterized by three unusual features ( 1 ) the phenotype of the emerging blast cells was that of pre-plasmacytoid cells as shown by plasma cell morphology and an immunological phenotype corresponding partially with CLL- or intermediate B-cells , partially with plasma cells ( terminal transferase - , common acute lymphocytic leukemia antigen - , Ia+ , surface immunoglobulin heavy chains - , surface kappa light chains + , intracytoplasmic immunoglobulin A+ and G+ , BA-1+ , polyclonal gammaglobulin production ) ; ( 2 ) cytogenetic analysis of spontaneous metaphases revealed that in addition to the typical CLL abnormality , trisomy 12 , in all of the cells , an additional translocation between chromosomes 14 and 17 was present in 40 % with a presumptive breakpoint on chromosome 14 ( q12-3 ) never described before ( commonly q32 ) and ( 3 ) the progression of the disease was associated with a striking increase in the expression by the transformed cells of specific binding sites for estradiol ( E2 ) due to an actual increase in total cellular receptor proteins and not to a change in receptor affinity for E2 .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 8 0 0 0 7 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 8 8 0 0 0 7 8 0 9 10 0 0 0 9 10 10 10 0 0 9 0 9 10 10 10 0 0 9 10 10 10 0 0 9 10 10 10 10 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Overexpression of Rel proteins demonstrated that p65-expressing Jurkat cells transcribed equally well a nuclear factor kappabeta reporter construct when costimulated with B7-1 or LFA-3 , but transcription of IL-2 promoter or CD28 response element ( CD28RE ) -driven reporters was superior in B7-1-costimulated cells .	0 0 9 10 0 0 5 6 6 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 9 0 9 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 5 6 0

Defects in actin-cap formation in Vav-deficient mice implicate an actin requirement for lymphocyte signal transduction .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Although actin polymerization is known to be required , the mechanisms underlying cap formation are unclear .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
We have studied the events underlying cap formation using mice bearing a null mutation in vav ( vav -/- ) , a gene that encodes a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor for the GTPase Rac .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 0 0 9 10 0
RESULTS : Lymphocytes from vav -/- mice failed to form T-cell receptor caps following activation and had a defective actin cytoskeleton .	0 0 7 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The vav-/- T cells were deficient in interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) production and proliferation , and the peak of Ca2+ mobilization was reduced although of normal duration .	0 7 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Activation of Jun N-terminal kinase or stress-activated kinase ( JNK or SAPK ) and mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) and the induction of the transcription factor NF-ATc1 and egr-1 genes was normal .	0 0 9 10 10 0 9 10 0 9 0 9 0 0 9 10 10 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 1 2 2 2 0 0 0
Despite the reduced Ca2+ mobilization , translocation of cytoplasmic NF-ATc to the nucleus was normal , reflecting that the lower levels of Ca2+ in vav-/- cells were still sufficient to activate calcineurin .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 0 0 0 0 0 9 0
Treatment of lymphocytes with cytochalasin D , which blocks actin polymerization , inhibited cap formation and produced defects in signaling and IL-2 transcriptional induction in response to antigen-receptor signaling that were nearly identical to those seen in vav-/- cells .	0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 0

CD14 -dependent activation of human endothelial cells by Bacteroides fragilis outer membrane .	9 0 0 0 7 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0
We studied the capacity of isolated Bacteriodes fragilis outer membrane , B. fragilis NCTC9343 lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ; endotoxin ) , and B. fragilis NCTC9343 capsular polysaccharides to activate human umbilical vein endothelial cell ( HUVEC ) monolayers .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
To assess HUVEC activation , E-selectin expression was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) , Northern blot analysis for E-selectin-specific mRNA , and electrophoretic gel mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) for NF-kappa B , a transcription factor necessary for E-selectin gene activation .	0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 0 9 10 0 0 1 2 0 0
Exposure of HUVECs to B. fragilis outer membrane fractions , separated from other components of the B. fragilis cell wall by isopycnic , sucrose gradient centrifugation , significantly increased surface expression of E-selectin and induced functional endothelial cell -dependent leukocyte adhesion .	0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 7 8 0 0 0 0

E-selectin expression induced by B. fragilis outer membranes was not blocked by polymixin B .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
In contrast , E-selectin expression induced by outer membrane fractions purified from E. coli was competitively inhibited by polymixin B .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Neither purified B. fragilis LPS , a prominent constituent of the outer membrane , nor purified B. fragilis capsular polysaccharides induced HUVEC activation .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Two different monoclonal antibodies directed against human CD14 completely inhibited B. fragilis outer membrane-induced NF-kappa B activation , E-selectin transcription , and E-selectin surface expression .	0 0 9 10 0 0 9 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
We conclude that the outer membrane component of the B. fragilis cell wall contains a proinflammatory factor ( s ) , that is not LPS , which induces human endothelial cell activation by a soluble CD14 -dependent mechanism .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 8 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0

In the present study , we sought to investigate whether constitutive NF-kappaB activity in chronically HIV-1-infected promonocytic U937 ( U9-IIIB ) and myeloblastic PLB-985 ( PLB-IIIB ) cells affects apoptotic signaling .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 5 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0

Inhibition of TNFalpha -induced NF-kappaB activation using the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) resulted in increased apoptosis in both U937 and U9-IIIB cells , while preactivation of NF-kappaB with the non-apoptotic inducer IL-1beta caused a relative decrease in apoptosis .	0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 9 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Inhibition of constitutive NF-kappaB activity in U9-IIIB and PLB-IIIB cells also induced apoptosis , suggesting that NF-kappaB protects cells from a persistent apoptotic signal .	0 0 0 9 0 0 5 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0
TNFalpha plus NAC treatment resulted in a marked decrease in Bcl-2 protein levels in HIV-1-infected cells , coupled with an increase in Bax protein compared to uninfected cells , suggesting that the difference in susceptibility to TNFalpha -induced apoptosis may relate to the differences in relative levels of Bcl-2 and Bax .	9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 0 7 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 9 0
The protective role of NF-kappaB in blocking TNFalpha- and HIV-1-induced apoptosis was supported by studies in Jurkat T cells engineered to express IkappaB alpha repressor mutants ( TD-IkappaB ) under the control of a tetracycline-responsive promoter .	0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 6 6 0 0 0 9 10 10 10 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0
Cells underwent apoptosis in response to TNFalpha only when NF-kappaB activation was inhibited by TD-IkappaB expression .	0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0
As was observed for the U9-IIIB cells , TNFalpha treatment also induced a marked decrease in Bcl-2 protein levels in TD-IkappaB expressing cells .	0 0 0 0 0 5 6 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 0 7 8 8 0
These experiments demonstrate that apoptotic signaling is perturbed in HIV-1-infected U9-IIIB cells and indicate that NF-kappaB activation may play an additional protective role against HIV-1-induced apoptosis in myeloid cells .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 0

The heterodimeric Ku protein , which comprises a 86 kDa ( Ku86 ) amd a 70 kDa ( Ku70 ) subunits , is an abundant nuclear DNA-binding protein which binds in vitro to DNA termini without sequence specificity .	0 0 9 10 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 10 10 0 0 9 10 10 10 10 10 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0
Ku is the DNA-targeting component of the large catalytic sub-unit of the DNA-dependent protein kinase complex ( DNA-PK [ CS ] ) , that plays a critical role in mammalian double-strand break repair and lymphoid V ( D ) J recombination .	9 0 0 9 10 0 0 0 9 10 0 0 9 10 10 10 0 9 10 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

The presence of this faster migrating complex was restricted to B cells among the circulating lymphocyte population .	0 0 0 0 9 10 10 0 0 0 7 8 0 0 7 8 8 0
Western blot analysis revealed that B cells express a variant form of the Ku86 protein with an apparent molecular weight of 69 kDa , and not the 86 kDa- full-length protein .	0 0 0 0 0 7 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 10 0
Although the heterodimer Ku70/variant-Ku86 binds to DNA-ends , this altered form of the Ku heterodimer has a decreased ability to recruit the catalytic component of the complex , DNA-PK ( CS ) , which contributes to an absence of detectable DNA-PK activity in B cells .	0 0 9 10 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 0

The p12 ( I ) protein , encoded by the pX open reading frame I of the human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) , is a hydrophobic protein that localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi .	0 9 10 10 10 10 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Although p12 ( I ) contains 4 minimal proline-rich , src homology 3-binding motifs ( PXXP ) , a characteristic commonly found in proteins involved in signaling pathways , it has not been known whether p12 ( I ) has a role in modulating intracellular signaling pathways .	0 9 10 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 10 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
This study demonstrated that p12 ( I ) binds to the cytoplasmic domain of the interleukin-2 receptor ( IL-2R ) beta chain that is involved in the recruitment of the Jak1 and Jak3 kinases .	0 0 0 0 9 10 10 10 0 0 0 9 10 0 0 9 10 10 10 10 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 10 0
As a result of this interaction , p12 ( I ) increases signal transducers and activators of transcription 5 ( STAT5 ) DNA binding and transcriptional activity and this effect depends on the presence of both IL-2R beta and gamma ( c ) chains and Jak3 .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 10 0 9 10 10 10 10 10 10 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 0 9 0
Transduction of primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) with a human immunodeficiency virus type 1-based retroviral vector expressing p12 ( I ) also resulted in increased STAT5 phosphorylation and DNA binding .	0 0 5 6 6 6 6 6 0 7 0 0 0 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 9 10 10 10 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0
However , p12 ( I ) could increase proliferation of human PBMCs only after stimulation of T-cell receptors by treatment of cells with low concentrations of alphaCD3 and alphaCD28 antibodies .	0 0 9 10 10 10 0 0 0 0 7 8 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 10 0

Together , these data indicate that p12 ( I ) may confer a proliferative advantage on HTLV-1-infected cells in the presence of suboptimal antigen stimulation and that this event may account for the clonal proliferation of infected T cells in vivo .	0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 8 0 0 0

Critical downregulatory role of IL-4 .	0 0 0 0 9 0
Interleukin ( IL ) -18 has been well characterized as a costimulatory factor for the induction of IL-12-mediated interferon ( IFN ) -gamma production by T helper ( Th ) 1 cells , but also can induce IL-4 production and thus facilitate the differentiation of Th2 cells .	9 10 10 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 10 10 10 0 0 7 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 0
To determine the mechanisms by which IL-18 might regulate these diametrically distinct immune responses , we have analyzed the role of cytokines in the regulation of IL-18 receptor alpha chain ( IL-18Ralpha ) expression .	0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 10 0 9 0 0 0
The majority of peripheral CD4 ( + ) T cells constitutively expressed the IL-18Ralpha .	0 0 0 7 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 9 0
Upon antigen stimulation in the presence of IL-12 , marked enhancement of IL-18Ralpha expression was observed .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0
IL-12 -mediated upregulation of IL-18Ralpha required IFN-gamma .	9 0 0 0 9 0 9 0
Activated CD4 ( + ) T cells that expressed low levels of IL-18Ralpha could produce IFN-gamma when stimulated with the combination of IL-12 and IL-18 , while CD4 ( + ) cells which expressed high levels of IL-18Ralpha could respond to IL-18 alone .	7 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 9 0 0 7 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 9 0 0
In contrast , T cell stimulation in the presence of IL-4 resulted in a downregulation of IL-18Ralpha expression .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0
Both IL-4 ( -/ ) - and signal transducer and activator of transcription ( Stat ) 6 ( -/ ) - T cells expressed higher levels of IL-18Ralpha after TCR stimulation .	0 7 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0

Thus , positive/negative regulation of the IL-18Ralpha by the major inductive cytokines ( IL-12 and IL-4 ) determines the capacity of IL-18 to polarize an immune response .	0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 9 0 9 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0

Inhibition of pro-inflammatory transcription factors such as activator protein ( AP ) -1 , signal transducers and activators of transcription ( STATs ) , nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) and nuclear factor ( NF ) -kappa B is thought to be a major action of glucocorticoids .	0 0 9 10 10 0 0 9 10 10 10 10 10 0 9 10 10 10 10 10 0 9 0 0 9 10 10 10 10 10 0 9 0 0 9 10 10 10 10 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

GR acts as a direct inhibitor of NF-kappa B-induced HAT activity and also by recruiting HDAC2 to the NF-kappa B/HAT complex .	9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 9 10 10 0
A sub-group of patients with glucocorticoid-insensitive asthma have an inability to induce histone acetylation in response to dexamethasone suggesting reduced expression of a GR-specific HAT .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0

Adipophilin is a sensitive marker for lipid loading in human blood monocytes .	9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 8 0
Adipophilin , a marker of lipid accumulation initially described in adipocytes , was recently shown to be induced in macrophage foam cells .	9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 8 0

Enzymatically modified low-density lipoprotein ( E-LDL ) induces rapid foam cell formation in monocytes and upregulates adipophilin mRNA and protein within 2 h of incubation .	9 10 10 10 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Adipophilin facilitates the uptake of free fatty acids , and here we demonstrate that free fatty acids increase is related to the early upregulation of adipophilin expression in blood monocytes .	9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 0
Fatty acids are ligands for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma ( PPARgamma ) , and the upregulation of adipophilin mRNA by PPARgamma agonists like 15d-PGJ ( 2 ) and ciglitazone indicates that PPARgamma may mediate the induction of adipophilin expression in human blood monocytes .	0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 4 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 8 0

In melanoma cell lines , two different patterns of MHC class II expression have been described , either an IFN gamma-inducible expression of HLA-DR and HLA-DP , with a faint or null expression of HLA-DQ , resembling that described for melanocytes , or a constitutive expression , i.e. , IFN-gamma independent , of all three HLA-D isotypes .	0 5 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0

To determine whether dendritic cells could be a possible target of the drug , we studied the effects of sulfasalazine and its metabolites , aminosalicylate and sulfapyridine , on in vitro maturation ( terminal differentiation ) of human myeloid dendritic cells .	0 0 0 7 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 8 8 0

In distinction to drug-free maturing dendritic cells , 2.5 micromol/L sulfasalazine upregulated the levels of CD14 and CD68 and downregulated the levels of CD40 , CD80 , and CD83 ( for all CD markers , p < 0.03 for difference between measurements in the absence and the presence of sulfasalazine ) .	0 0 0 0 0 7 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 9 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
From concentration-dependent changes in CD83 expression , we found an apparent ID50 > > 1.5 micromol/L sulfasalazine .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The apparent ID50 value for aminosalicylate-inhibited maturation was 4 micromol/L .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

At 1.25 micromol/L , sulfasalazine largely inhibited NF-kB activation in dendritic cells .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 0

It is known that glucocorticoids ( GC ) , used for treatment of AID , increase apoptosis in the thymus resulting in decreased numbers of CD4+ CD8+ thymocytes .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 8 0
It was asked whether androgens , in contrast to oestrogens , exert their favourable effects in the treatment of AID by a mechanism comparable to that described for GC by eliminating the apoptosis prone CD4+ CD8+ population in the thymus .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 8 0 0 0 0
Although both androgens and oestrogens proved thymolytic , a significantly decreased percentage of CD4+ CD8+ thymocytes was observed by flow cytometry after treatment of mice with the androgen methyltestosterone , but not with the oestrogen ethinylestradiol .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Functional correction of FA-C cells with FANCC suppresses the expression of interferon gamma-inducible genes .	0 0 0 7 8 0 9 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 0
Because hematopoietic cells derived from Fanconi anemia ( FA ) patients of the C-complementation group ( FA-C ) are hypersensitive to the inhibitory effects of interferon gamma ( IFNgamma ) , the products of certain IFNgamma-inducible genes known to influence hematopoietic cell survival were quantified .	0 7 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
High constitutive expression of the IFNgamma-inducible genes , IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 gamma subunit ( ISGF3gamma ) , IFN regulatory factor-1 ( IRF-1 ) , and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 ( WAF1 ) was found in FANCC mutant B lymphoblasts , low-density bone marrow cells , and murine embryonic fibroblasts .	0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 9 10 10 10 10 10 0 9 0 0 9 10 10 0 9 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 10 0 9 0 0 0 0 9 0 7 8 0 7 8 8 8 0 0 7 8 8 0

In an attempt to clarify mechanisms by which FA-C cells overexpress IFNgamma-inducible genes in the face of defective STAT1 phosphorylation , it was reasoned that decreased levels of activated STAT1 might result in reduced expression of a hematopoietic IFNgamma-responsive protein that normally modulates expression of other IFNgamma-responsive genes .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0

Thus , the FANCC protein functions to modulate expression of a family of genes that in normal cells are inducible only by specific environmental cues for apoptosis or mitogenic inhibition , but it does so independently of the classic IFN-STAT1 pathway and is not the direct result of reduced ICSBP expression .	0 0 0 9 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0

Tricyclodecan-9-yl-xanthogenate ( D609 ) has been extensively studied in biological systems and exhibits a variety of biological functions , including antiviral , antitumor , and anti-inflammatory activities .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Most of these activities have been largely attributed to the inhibitory effect of D609 on phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0
However , as a xanthate derivative , D609 is a strong electrolyte and readily dissociates to xanthate anions and cations of alkali metals in solution .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Xanthate anions and protonated xanthic acid contain a free thiol moiety and are highly reductive .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Furthermore , preincubation of lymphocytes with D609 resulted in a significant diminution of ionizing radiation ( IR ) -induced 1 ) production of reactive oxygen species ; 2 ) decrease in intracellular reduced glutathione ; 3 ) oxidative damage to proteins and lipids ; and 4 ) activation of nuclear factor-kappaB .	0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0

Inhibition of AP-1 by the glucocorticoid-inducible protein GILZ .	0 0 9 0 0 0 9 10 0
The immunosuppressive effects of glucocorticoids arise largely by inhibition of cytokine gene expression , which has been ascribed to interference between the glucocorticoid receptor and transcription factors such as AP-1 and NF-kappa B as well as by competition for common coactivators .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 9 10 0 0 9 0 9 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Here we show that glucocorticoid-induced inhibition of interleukin-2 mRNA expression in activated normal T cells required new protein synthesis , suggesting that this phenomenon is secondary to expression of glucocorticoid-regulated genes .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
One of the most prominent glucocorticoid-induced genes is glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper ( GILZ ) , which has been reported to inhibit activation-induced up-regulation of Fas ligand ( FasL ) mRNA .	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 2 2 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 4 4 4 4 4 0

This could be accounted for by GILZ -mediated inhibition of Egr-2 and Egr-3 , NFAT/AP-1 -inducible transcription factors that bind a regulatory element in the FasL promoter and up-regulate FasL expression .	0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 9 0 9 0 9 0 9 10 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0
GILZ also potently inhibited AP-1-driven and IL-2 promoter-driven reporter constructs , and recombinant GILZ specifically interacted with c-Fos and c-Jun in vitro and inhibited the binding of active AP-1 to its target DNA .	9 0 0 0 1 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 9 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 0 0 0 0
Whereas homodimerization of GILZ required the presence of its leucine zipper , the interaction with c-Fos and c-Jun occurred through the N-terminal 60-amino acid region of GILZ .	0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 0 0 0 9 0 9 0 0 0 9 9 10 10 0 9 0

Recruitment of p300 by cAMP-responsive element-binding protein-Rel cross-talk at the composite CD28 response element ( CD28RE ) - TRE element of the IL-2 promoter is essential for promoter inducibility during T-cell activation , and CD28RE-TRE is the exclusive target of the human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I oncoprotein Tax .	0 0 9 0 9 10 10 0 0 0 9 10 10 10 0 9 0 0 1 2 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 0 0 0 0 9 10 0
The intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity of p300 is dispensable for activation of the IL-2 promoter , and the N-terminal 743 residues contain the minimal structural requirements for synergistic transactivation of the CD28RE-TRE , the IL-2 promoter , and endogenous IL-2 gene expression .	0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 9 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 1 2 0 0

BACKGROUND : The precise nature of allergen-specific cytokine responses in atopics versus non-atopics , in particular the 'Th1 polarity ' of responses in non-atopics , remains controversial .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
This is due in part to the relative insensitivity of cytokine detection systems , and associated variations in kinetics of cytokine production and catabolism in in vitro culture systems .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

METHODS : Cord blood mononuclear cells were Th1- or Th2-polarized by culture in IL-12- or IL-4-employing established methods ; PBMC from house dust mite ( HDM ) -sensitive atopics and controls were stimulated overnight with HDM ; cytokine production was measured by ELISA and GATA-3 mRNA expression by PCR .	0 0 7 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 4 0 0 0 0
RESULTS : Cytokine -driven Th2 polarization of naive T cells is associated with marked upregulation of GATA-3 expression , whereas a reciprocal expression pattern accompanies differentiation towards the Th1 cytokine phenotype .	0 0 9 0 0 0 0 7 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Although the immediate-early proteins of both herpes simplex virus ( HSV ) and cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) are known to modify promyelocytic leukemia ( PML ) ( ND10 ) bodies in the nucleus of the host cell , it has been unclear whether lytic infection with gamma herpesviruses induces a similar effect .	0 0 9 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Inhibition of Th1 differentiation by IL-6 is mediated by SOCS1 .	0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 9 0
Interleukin 6 ( IL-6 ) is a cytokine produced by immune and nonimmune cells and exhibits functional pleiotropy and redundancy .	9 10 0 9 0 0 0 9 0 0 7 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
IL-6 plays an important role in the differentiation of several cell types .	9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

IL-6 upregulates suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 ( SOCS1 ) expression in activated CD4+ T cells , thereby interfering with signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 ( STAT1 ) phosphorylation induced by interferon gamma ( IFNgamma ) .	9 0 9 10 10 10 10 0 9 0 0 0 7 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 10 10 10 10 0 9 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 9 0 0
Inhibition of IFNgamma receptor-mediated signals by IL-6 prevents autoregulation of IFNgamma gene expression by IFNgamma during CD4+ T cell activation , thereby preventing Th1 differentiation .	0 0 9 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 9 0 7 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Interaction between CCAAT/enhancer binding protein and cyclic AMP response element binding protein 1 regulates human immunodeficiency virus type 1 transcription in cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage .	0 0 9 10 10 0 9 10 10 10 10 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 0
Recent observations have shown two CCAAT/enhancer binding protein ( C/EBP ) binding sites to be critically important for efficient human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) replication within cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage , a cell type likely involved in transport of the virus to the brain .	0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Additionally , sequence variation at C/EBP site I , which lies immediately upstream of the distal nuclear factor kappa B site and immediately downstream of a binding site for activating transcription factor ( ATF ) / cyclic AMP response element binding protein ( CREB ) , has been shown to affect HIV-1 long terminal repeat ( LTR ) activity .	0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 0 9 0 0 9 10 10 10 10 10 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 2 0 1 0 0 0
Given that C/EBP proteins have been shown to interact with many other transcription factors including members of the ATF/CREB family , we proceeded to determine whether an adjacent ATF/CREB binding site could affect C/EBP protein binding to C/EBP site I .	0 0 9 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 0 0 9 10 0 0 1 2 2 0
Electrophoretic mobility shift analyses indicated that selected ATF/CREB site variants assisted in the recruitment of C/EBP proteins to an adjacent , naturally occurring , low-affinity C/EBP site .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0
This biophysical interaction appears to occur via at least two mechanisms .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
First , low amounts of CREB-1 and C/EBP appear to heterodimerize and bind to a site consisting of a half site from both the ATF/CREB and C/EBP binding sites .	0 0 0 0 0 9 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 2 2 0
In addition , CREB-1 homodimers bind to the ATF/CREB site and recruit C/EBP dimers to their cognate weak binding sites .	0 0 0 9 10 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 9 10 0 0 0 1 2 2 0
This interaction is reciprocal , since C/EBP dimer binding to a strong C/EBP site leads to enhanced CREB-1 recruitment to ATF/CREB sites that are weakly bound by CREB .	0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 9 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 9 0
Sequence variation at both C/EBP and ATF/CREB sites affects the molecular interactions involved in mediating both of these mechanisms .	0 0 0 0 1 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Most importantly , sequence variation at the ATF/CREB binding site affected basal LTR activity as well as LTR function following interleukin-6 stimulation , a treatment that leads to increases in C/EBP activation .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Selective inhibition of interleukin-4 gene expression in human T cells by aspirin .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 8 0 0 0
Previous studies indicated that aspirin ( acetylsalicylic acid [ ASA ] ) can have profound immunomodulatory effects by regulating cytokine gene expression in several types of cells .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
This study is the first in which concentrations of ASA in the therapeutic range were found to significantly reduce interleukin ( IL ) -4 secretion and RNA expression in freshly isolated and mitogen-primed human CD4+ T cells .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0
In contrast , ASA did not affect IL-13 , interferon-gamma , and IL-2 expression .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 9 0 0 9 0 0
ASA inhibited IL-4 , but not IL-2 , promoter-driven chloramphenicol acetyltransferase expression in transiently transfected Jurkat T cells .	0 0 9 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 6 6 0
The structurally unrelated nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs indomethacin and flurbiprofen did not affect cytokine gene expression in T cells , whereas the weak cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor salicylic acid was at least as effective as ASA in inhibiting IL-4 expression and promoter activity .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0
The inhibitory effect of ASA on IL-4 transcription was not mediated by decreased nuclear expression of the known salicylate target nuclear factor ( NF ) -kappaB and was accompanied by reduced binding of an inducible factor to an IL-4 promoter region upstream of , but not overlapping , the NF of activated T cells- and NF-kappaB-binding P1 element .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0
It is concluded that anti-inflammatory salicylates , by means of a previously unrecognized mechanism of action , can influence the nature of adaptive immune responses by selectively inhibiting the expression of IL-4 , a critical effector of these responses , in CD4+ T cells .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 8 0

RESULTS : C57BL/6 ( B6 ) , 129/Sv , and ( B6 x 129/ Sv ) F1 hybrid mice , all H-2b strains , were susceptible to mBSA /IL-1-induced arthritis , whereas C3H/HeJ ( H-2k ) mice were not .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
B6 mice lacking T and B cells ( RAG1-/- ) or major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class II antigens ( MHCII-/- ) , and B6 mice treated with a CD4+ T cell-depleting monoclonal antibody , were resistant to disease .	0 0 0 7 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 0

In B6 mice , flow cytometry demonstrated an IL-1-dependent leukocyte infiltration into the synovial compartment and RNase protection assays revealed induction of messenger RNA ( mRNA ) for the chemokines monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 , macrophage inhibitory protein 2 ( MIP-2 ) , RANTES , MIP-1alpha , and MIP-1beta , in vivo and in vitro .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 4 0 3 0 0 0 9 9 10 10 10 0 9 10 10 10 0 9 0 0 9 0 9 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Positive and negative regulation of granulopoiesis by endogenous RARalpha .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0

Whether these translocations relate to a role for endogenous RARalpha in normal granulopoiesis remains uncertain because most studies addressing this question have used non-physiological overexpression systems .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Our results demonstrate that RARalpha is dispensable for granulopoiesis , as RARalpha ( -/- ) mice have a normal granulocyte population despite an impaired ability to respond to retinoids .	0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
However , although it is not absolutely required , RARalpha can bidirectionally modulate granulopoiesis .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0
RARalpha stimulates differentiation in response to exogenous retinoic acid .	9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Furthermore , endogenous retinoids control granulopoiesis in vivo , as either vitamin A-deficient mice or animals treated with an RAR antagonist accumulate more immature granulocytes in their bone marrow .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 0 0 0 0 0
Conversely , RARalpha acts to limit differentiation in the absence of ligand because granulocyte precursors from RARalpha ( -/- ) mice differentiate earlier in culture .	0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 7 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Theileria is an intracellular parasite that causes lymphoproliferative disorders in cattle , and infection of leucocytes induces a transformed phenotype similar to tumour cells , but the mechanisms by which the parasite induces this phenotype are not understood .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

The induction of this complex by SF was not affected by neutralization of TNF-alpha or IL-6 in SF , and the complex was not inducible by TNF-alpha , IL-1beta , TNF-alpha / IL-1beta , IL-6 , platelet derived growth factor , lipopolysaccharide , or tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 9 0 9 0 9 0 9 10 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

The expression of almost all of the cytokines produced by eosinophils , including the proallergic cytokine IL-4 , is now known to be regulated at the level of transcription by members of the nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) family of transcription factors .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 7 0 0 0 9 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 10 10 10 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0

The Nef protein of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) has been shown to enhance the infectivity of virus particles , downmodulate cell surface proteins , and associate with many intracellular proteins that are thought to facilitate HIV infection .	0 9 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

The Nef-ER is kept in an inactive state due to steric hindrance , and addition of the membrane-permeable drug 4-hydroxytamoxifen ( 4-HT ) , which binds to the ER domain , leads to inducible activation of Nef-ER within cells .	0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0
We demonstrate that Nef-ER inducibly associates with the 62-kDa Ser/Thr kinase and is localized to specific membrane microdomains ( lipid rafts ) only after activation .	0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Half-maximal downmodulation of cell surface CD4 required very little active Nef-ER and occurred as early as 4 h after addition of 4-HT .	0 0 0 9 10 10 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
In contrast , 50 % downmodulation of HLA-A2 by Nef required 16 to 24 h and about 50- to 100-fold-greater concentrations of 4-HT .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

The facts that PMN influx was preceded by increased MIP-2 mRNA expression , suggesting that MIP-2 is involved in the development of NaVO3-induced pulmonary inflammation , whereas increased MIP-1alpha mRNA expression was followed by decreased AMs in BAL cells , suggesting AMs might be activated by MIP-1alpha , adherent to the lining surface of the airways and then resistant to be washed out .	0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 4 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 7 8 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

T-cell -mediated regulation of osteoclastogenesis by signalling cross-talk between RANKL and IFN-gamma .	7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 9 0
Bone resorption is regulated by the immune system , where T-cell expression of RANKL ( receptor activator of nuclear factor ( NF ) -kappaB ligand ) , a member of the tumour-necrosis factor family that is essential for osteoclastogenesis , may contribute to pathological conditions , such as autoimmune arthritis .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 9 0 9 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

IFN-gamma induces rapid degradation of the RANK adapter protein , TRAF6 ( tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 ) , which results in strong inhibition of the RANKL -induced activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB and JNK .	9 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 0 9 0 9 10 10 10 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 9 10 9 0 9 0

Stromal-derived factor 1 and thrombopoietin regulate distinct aspects of human megakaryopoiesis .	9 10 10 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The role of the chemokine binding stromal-derived factor 1 ( SDF-1 ) in normal human megakaryopoiesis at the cellular and molecular levels and its comparison with that of thrombopoietin ( TPO ) have not been determined .	0 0 0 0 9 0 9 10 10 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0

However , it does induce chemotaxis , trans-Matrigel migration , and secretion of matrix metalloproteinase 9 ( MMP-9 ) and vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) by these cells , and both SDF-1 and TPO increase the adhesion of alpha ( IIb ) beta ( 3 ) ( + ) cells to fibrinogen and vitronectin .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 9 0 0 9 10 10 10 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 9 0 0 0 0 7 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 9 0 9 0
Investigating the intracellular signaling pathways induced by SDF-1 and TPO revealed some overlapping patterns of protein phosphorylation/activation ( mitogen-activated protein kinase [ MAPK ] p42/44 , MAPK p38 , and AKT [ protein kinase B ] ) and some that were distinct for TPO ( eg , JAK-STAT ) and for SDF-1 ( eg , NF-kappa B ) .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 10 10 10 10 0 9 10 0 0 9 10 10 10 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 9 10 0 0
It was also found that though inhibition of phosphatidyl-inositol 3-kinase ( PI-3K ) by LY294002 in alpha ( IIb ) beta ( 3 ) ( + ) cells induced apoptosis and inhibited chemotaxis adhesion and the secretion of MMP-9 and VEGF , the inhibition of MAPK p42/44 ( by the MEK inhibitor U0126 ) had no effect on the survival , proliferation , and migration of these cells .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 9 0 0 0 0 7 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 9 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Hence , it is suggested that the proliferative effect of TPO is more related to activation of the JAK-STAT pathway ( unique to TPO ) , and the PI-3K-AKT axis is differentially involved in TPO- and SDF-1-dependent signaling .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Although both isomers were expressed in human erythroid-megakaryocytic cell lines , megakaryocytic maturation with loss of erythroid phenotype induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) resulted in exclusive downregulation of fNF-E2 , suggesting that fNF-E2 promoter is more erythroid specific .	0 0 0 0 0 0 5 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0

Site-directed mutagenesis studies indicate that the homodimerization function of p65 is dependent upon the presence of cysteine 216 and a conserved recognition motif for protein kinase A ( RRPS ; amino acids 273 to 276 ) , both of which reside within a 91-amino-acid segment of the Rel homology domain that mediates self-association .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 0 0 0 0

Egr-1 is an immediate early gene that is rapidly upregulated in response to mitogenic signals induced by antigen receptor crosslinking on murine B lymphocytes .	1 0 0 1 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 8 0

We compared the expression of Egr-1 during B cell stimulation with Fab'2 and IgG anti-immunoglobulin ( anti-Ig ) , since it is known that Fab'2 anti-Ig is mitogenic while IgG anti-Ig is not , owing to a dominant inhibitory effect of crosslinking the B cell Fc gamma RII to membrane Ig .	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 9 10 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 0 0 9 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 10 10 0 9 10 0

A [ 3H ] dexamethasone radioligand-binding assay was used to measure the number of glucocorticoid receptors ( GR ) and dissociation constant ( Kd ) in PBMC from normal donors and patients with SR asthma , cultured in the absence and presence of these cytokines .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0
PBMC from normal donors incubated for 48 h in the presence of combination IL-2 + IL-4 had nuclear GR with significantly reduced binding affinity ( GR Kd = 36.1 +/- 1.63 nM , mean +/- SEM ; p = 0.0001 ) as compared with PBMC incubated with medium alone ( GR Kd = 6.74 +/- 0.46 nM ) .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Freshly isolated PBMC from four patients with SR asthma had a significantly reduced GR-binding affinity ( Kd = 40.0 +/- 2.68 nM ; p = 0.0001 ) when compared with seven normal subjects ( 7.15 +/- 0.41 nM ) .	0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Some liberated dimers were retained in the cytoplasm , however , through binding to newly synthesized I kappa B alpha , a finding which strongly suggests ( i ) that the LPS-induced signal causes dissociation of complexes rather than preventing their association and ( ii ) that dissociation results from modification of I kappa B alpha and not of c-rel or p65 .	0 9 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 10 0 0 0 9 0 9 0

Vitamin D receptor quantitation in human blood mononuclear cells in health and disease .	9 10 10 0 0 7 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0
Vitamin D receptor ( VDR ) concentration was quantitated in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) from patients with absorptive hypercalciuria ( AH ) and patients with high 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 due to acquired or transient disease states and the results compared to those in normal subjects .	9 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 8 8 8 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Virus infection does not appear to alter the amount of RelA ( p65 ) or NFKB1 ( p50 ) but rather affects the capacity of I kappa B alpha to sequester RelA ( p65 ) , therefore leading to constitutive levels of RelA DNA binding activity and to increased levels of NF-kappa B-dependent gene activity .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 9 0 0 9 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 10 10 10 0 0 9 10 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
